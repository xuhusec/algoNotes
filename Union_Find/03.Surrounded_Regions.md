## Surrounded Regions

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/)

Given an m \* n matrix board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by 'X'.

A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surround region.

### Solution

From the description and the example, we can find we would keep the 'O' when it is on the boarder or connect to a 'O' boarder through zero or more 'O' in between. Other 'O's would be captured by 'X's and they should be flipping to 'X'. 

To be honest, the DFS solution would be much easy to figure out. We would talk that later. To resolve this by UnionFind, we find the connection. The goal is to find 'O' and the boarder and 'O' can be connected to an 'O' on the boarder through 'O'(s). The group is clear. But how to do check if they are connected to a 'O' on the boarder in later phase when we flip?  The solution here is to add a special entry in the parent array. That would representing the board. And all 'O' on the boarder would point its parent to that special value. Then, in the later phases, we can just test if an 'O' is in the same group of the special entry. If yes, we do not flip. Otherwise, we flip.  We can just add an additional entry in the last to be the special entry. The following example set a large rank to the special value so that all it would be the parent for all 'O' in boarder group. But please be aware your data size in case that would be overflow. Here the max is 200 * 200. If we double it that would be far less than Integer.MAX_VALUE

Without set the special value.

```java
    private final int[][] DIRS = {{0,1},{0,-1},{1,0},{-1,0}};
    public void solve(char[][] board) {
        final int R = board.length;
        final int C = board[0].length;
        final int BOUNDARY = R * C; 
        //additional cell for border
        UnionFord uf = new UnionFord(BOUNDARY+1);

        for (int i = 0; i < R; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < C; ++j) {
                if (board[i][j] == 'X') { continue; }
                if (i == 0 || i == R - 1 || j == 0 || j == C - 1) {
                    uf.union(mapToId(i,j,C), BOUNDARY);
                } else {
                    int idx = mapToId(i,j,C);
                    for (int[] dir : DIRS) {
                        int row = i + dir[0];
                        int col = j + dir[1];
                        if (board[row][col] == 'O') {
                            uf.union(mapToId(row,col,C),idx);
                        }
                    }
                }

            }
        }

        int boardParent = uf.find(BOUNDARY);
        for (int i = 1; i < R - 1; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j < C - 1; ++j) {
                if (board[i][j] == 'X') { continue; }
                if (uf.find(mapToId(i,j,C)) != boardParent) {
                    board[i][j] = 'X';
                } 
            }
        }
    }

    private int mapToId(int r, int c, int colCount) {
        return r * colCount + c; 
    }

    private static class UnionFord {
        private final int[] parent;
        
        UnionFord(int n) {
            parent = new int[n];
            for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
                parent[i] = i;
            }
        }

        int find(int p) {
            if ( p != parent[p] ) {
                parent[p] = find(parent[p]);
            }
            return parent[p];
        }

        void union (int x, int y) {
            int pX = find(x);
            int pY = find(y);
            if (pX == pY) { return; }
            parent[pX] = pY;
        }
    }
```



DFS

we can just search from the board via a DFS and set a special value in for connected 'O'. Then we can iterate the board and flip 'O' to 'X' and flip the special value to 'O'.

```java
    private final int[][] DIRS = {{0,1},{0,-1},{1,0},{-1,0}};
    private final char S = 'A';
    public void solve(char[][] board) {
        final int R = board.length;
        final int C = board[0].length;
        // explore O from the first and last row
        for (int i = 0; i < C; ++i) {
            dfs(board, 0, i);
            dfs(board, R-1, i);
        }
        //explore O from the first and last column
        for (int i = 0; i < R; ++i) {
            dfs(board, i, 0);
            dfs(board, i, C - 1);
        }
        //flip
        for (int i = 0; i < R; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < C; ++j) {
                if (board[i][j] == 'O') {
                    board[i][j] = 'X';
                } else if (board[i][j] == S) {
                    board[i][j] = 'O';
                } 
            }
        }
        
    }
    
    private void dfs(char[][] board, int r, int c) {
        if (r < 0 || r >= board.length || c < 0 || c >= board[0].length || board[r][c] != 'O') {
            return;
        }
        board[r][c] = S;
        for (int[] dir : DIRS) {
            dfs(board, r + dir[0], c + dir[1]);
        }
    }
```

Time complexity: both dfs and iteration would be the whole board O(mn) where m and n are # of rows and # of columns 

Space complexity: The max depth of dfs is the whole board O(mn)
