## Satisfiability of Equality Equations

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/satisfiability-of-equality-equations/)

You are given an array of strings equations that represent relationships between variables where each string equations[i] is of length 4 and takes one of two different forms: "x<sub>i</sub>==y<sub>i</sub>" or "x<sub>i</sub>!=y<sub>i</sub>".Here, x<sub>i</sub> and y<sub>i</sub> are lowercase letters (not necessarily different) that represent one-letter variable names.

Return true if it is possible to assign integers to variable names so as to satisfy all the given equations, or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: equations = ["a==b","b!=a"]
Output: false
Explanation: If we assign say, a = 1 and b = 1, then the first equation is satisfied, but not the second.
There is no way to assign the variables to satisfy both equations.
Example 2:

Input: equations = ["b==a","a==b"]
Output: true
Explanation: We could assign a = 1 and b = 1 to satisfy both equations.
 

Constraints:

1 <= equations.length <= 500
equations[i].length == 4
equations[i][0] is a lowercase letter.
equations[i][1] is either '=' or '!'.
equations[i][2] is '='.
equations[i][3] is a lowercase letter.

### Solution

For equality, it has transitivity. a == b and b == c => a == c. This seems perfect for UnionFind. Of course this can be resolved by DFS as well.

For inequality, it does not have transitivity, given a != b and b != c, a == c is still possible. So we cannot track them with UnionFind. We need a set or a boolean[][] to track inequality. 
As the euqlaity has transivity,
When two variable is not equal, those equals to first should be also not equals to those equals to the second one.
Similary when we set to euqal, those equals to the first should also be equals to those equals to the second.

So we need to customize the UnionFind structure to track those information. 
1. When two are set not equals, we need make sure they are not already equals. This part is simple, we can just use UnionFind.
2. When two are set equals, we need make sure none of element that not equals to the first is equals to the second and we need set those also not equal to the second as well.

        for (String equation : equations) {
            int first = equation.charAt(0) - 'a';
            char second = equation.charAt(1);
            int last = equation.charAt(3) - 'a';
            if (second == '!') {
                if (uf.find(first) == uf.find(last)) {
                    return false;
                }
                uf.setNotEqual(first, last);
            } else {

Time Complexity: There is a loop. union now may take O(n). Other part is alpha(n) almost O(1) => O(mn) where m is number of equals and n is number of variable names
Space Complexity: O(n) for UnionFind
