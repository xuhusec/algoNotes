## Redundant Connection

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection)

In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.

You are given a graph that started as a tree with n nodes labeled from 1 to n, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to n, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array edges of length n where edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>] indicates that there is an edge between nodes a<sub>i</sub> and b<sub>i</sub> in the graph.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of n nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.

Constraints:

* n == edges.length
* 3 <= n <= 1000
* edges[i].length == 2
* 1 <= a<sub>i</sub> < b<sub>i</sub> <= edges.length
* a<sub>i</sub> != b<sub>i</sub>
* There are no repeated edges.
* The given graph is connected.

### Solution

The question asks to remove the last input that can form a cycle in the graph. We can use DFS to explore if there is a cycle by adding a new edge. This would explore the graph every time.
Here the UnionFind can rescue. We can set union all the connected edge by its connected head and tail nodes. When a new edge is added, if the two nodes are in different union find set. They are not connected. If yes, that is the last input to form the cycle, and we should return it. In this way, we avoid exploring the connected nodes by dfs every time. 
We can set the size of unionFind to be the length of edges array because of 1 <= a<sub>i</sub> < b<sub>i</sub> <= edges.length.
```java
    public int[] findRedundantConnection(int[][] edges) {
        UnionFind uf = new UnionFind(edges.length + 1);
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            // check if the new input can form a cycle
            if (uf.find(edge[0]) == uf.find(edge[1])) {
                return edge;
            }
            //union both ends/nodes
            uf.union(edge[0], edge[1]);
        }
        return new int[0];
    }

private static class UnionFind {
    int[] parents;
    int[] ranks;

    public UnionFind(int n) {
        parents = new int[n];
        ranks = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            parents[i] = i;
            ranks[i] = 1;
        }
    }

    public int find(int x) {
        if (x != parents[x]) {
            parents[x] = find(parents[x]);
        }
        return parents[x];
    }

    public void union(int x, int y) {
        int pX = find(x);
        int pY = find(y);

        if (pX == pY) {
            return;
        }

        if (ranks[pX] > ranks[pY]) {
            ranks[pX] += ranks[pX];
            parents[pY] = pX;
        } else {
            ranks[pY] += ranks[pX];
            parents[pX] = pY;
        }
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n * time of find) where n is the length of edges

Space complexity: ranks and parents O(n)
