## Snapshot Array

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/snapshot-array/)

Implement a SnapshotArray that supports the following interface:

SnapshotArray(int length) initializes an array-like data structure with the given length.  Initially, each element equals 0.
void set(index, val) sets the element at the given index to be equal to val.
int snap() takes a snapshot of the array and returns the snap_id: the total number of times we called snap() minus 1.
int get(index, snap_id) returns the value at the given index, at the time we took the snapshot with the given snap_id
 

Example 1:
```
Input: ["SnapshotArray","set","snap","set","get"]
[[3],[0,5],[],[0,6],[0,0]]
Output: [null,null,0,null,5]
Explanation: 
SnapshotArray snapshotArr = new SnapshotArray(3); // set the length to be 3
snapshotArr.set(0,5);  // Set array[0] = 5
snapshotArr.snap();  // Take a snapshot, return snap_id = 0
snapshotArr.set(0,6);
snapshotArr.get(0,0);  // Get the value of array[0] with snap_id = 0, return 5
```

### Solution
The question simulates the Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC) in database. Of course, this is simplied version because we do not need to care about deletion. Implementing this function would help a lot with snapshot isolation. In postgress, different versions of data are stored as tuples and they can be queried by its key and version. In MySQL, this is done by redo log. The result is found by key and apply the redo log back to the version you want to query.
Here I would implement something like postgres. each version is stored in a TreeMap and we can find the result by its key and snap it. The key helps locating the TreeMap and the snapshot id would locate the exactly entry.

```java
class SnapshotArray {
    private final TreeMap<Integer,Integer>[] array;
    private int version = 0;
    
    public SnapshotArray(int length) {
        array = new TreeMap[length];
    }
    
    public void set(int index, int val) {
        //create TreeMap if there is no one for the index (or key)
        if (array[index] == null) {
            array[index] = new TreeMap<Integer,Integer>();
        }
        array[index].put(version, val);
    }
    
    public int snap() {
        return version++;
    }
    
    public int get(int index, int snap_id) {
        // if the index is not assoicated with any value return 0;
        if (array[index] == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        // find the greatest snap that less than or equal to the snap id.
        Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry = array[index].floorEntry(snap_id);
        return entry == null ? 0 : entry.getValue();
    }
}
```
