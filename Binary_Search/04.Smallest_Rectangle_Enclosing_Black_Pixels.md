## Smallest Rectangle Enclosing Black Pixels

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-rectangle-enclosing-black-pixels/)

You are given an m x n binary matrix image where 0 represents a white pixel and 1 represents a black pixel.

The black pixels are connected (i.e., there is only one black region). Pixels are connected horizontally and vertically.

Given two integers x and y that represents the location of one of the black pixels, return the area of the smallest (axis-aligned) rectangle that encloses all black pixels.

You must write an algorithm with less than O(mn) runtime complexity

#### Solution

The navie way to slove this quesiton is to perform dfs and record four boundaries. In worst case, that require visiting all cells O(mn). But the question tells the black pixels are connected. That means if a black pixel is found, it is able to find a path from {x,y} to this point. If no black pixel is found, no black pixel neither in the row being further away from {x,y}. Also, we have boundaries of the original matrix. So, we can solve this question with binary search. 4 binary search would help finding 4 boundaries. So, the width and height of the area can be calculated. Please note when searching up and left side, we trying to find the minimun value. And for the other two sides, we try to find the largest value. So we need two binary search functions.  

```java
    public int minArea(char[][] image, int x, int y) {
        // find 4 boundaries by binary search
        int up = findMin(image, 0, x, true);
        int down = findMax(image, x, image.length - 1, true);
        int left = findMin(image, 0, y, false);
        int right = findMax(image, y, image[0].length - 1, false);
        // calculate area
        return (right - left + 1) * (down - up + 1);
    }
    private int findMin(char[][] image, int lo, int hi, boolean isRow) {
        // find min
        while (lo < hi) {
            // take mid on the left side of the true mid. e.g lo = 0, hi = 1 => mid = 0;
            int mid = lo + (hi - lo)/2;
            // if we can find a black pixel in Row mid. The boundary >= mid. move hi to mid 
            if (isInArea(image, mid, isRow)) {
                hi = mid;
            } else {
                lo = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return lo;
    }
    
    private int findMax(char[][] image, int lo, int hi, boolean isRow) {
        while (lo < hi) {
            int mid = hi - (hi - lo)/2;
            if (isInArea(image, mid, isRow)) {
                lo = mid;
            } else {
                hi = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return lo;
    }
    
    private boolean isInArea(char[][] image, int index, boolean isRow) {
        if (isRow) {
            for (char ch : image[index]) {
                if (ch == '1') {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        } else {
            for (int i = 0; i < image.length; ++i) {
                if (image[i][index] == '1') {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
```
Time Complexity: 2 binary search on row and 2 on column the isInArea will visit another dimension O(mlogn + nlogm);
