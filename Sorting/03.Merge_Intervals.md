## Merge Intervals

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)

Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [start~i~ , end~i~], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.



### Solution

##### Brute Force

The question is asking for merge intervals. If two intervals can be merged, they would have overlap. A brute force method would to create a boolean array. And fill true in those index defined by the intervals. E.g. for [1,3], b[1] = true; b[2] = true; b[3] = true. After iterating the intervals, you have every interval to be marked as true in the boolean array. Then we can go through the intervals combine all the consecutive false to the available range. Of course, we need to record the min of the start and the max of end in the intervals. no boolean beyond them would be considered. However, this is a slow algorithm. It requires iterate from start to end for the final result. Let note them as m (end - start). Then, for each mark process going through the interval array is nm where n is number of int arrays in the intervals. So it is O(nm). And the space complexity is at least m.

##### Sorting with Important events

We can try to improve the Brute Force solution. We can go over the event without going through the timestamp one by one? Each intervals actually provide two events for us. It is an OPEN event happened at the start time and a CLOSED event happened at the end time.  When a interval is not covered?  That is when all OPEN events find their matched CLOSED events. But we do not care about which CLOSED event is for which OPEN event. We only need to find out if every OPEN event find a match. This is like to verify parentheses that only contains one kind of parentheses. We can just use count to find out if all OPEN find their CLOSED. So, we would break the intervals into two events and mark open to be 1 and closed to be -1 so that they can directly be added to the count. Because it is timestamp, we can just sort them before counting. Also, for the boundary case, \[1, 5\] and \[5, 8\]. They are considered to have an overlap at 5. So we need to count the OPEN before CLOSED. That is when time is matched, OPEN event first. When we find the count is 0, we know it is the end of a merged interval. We should record the start before hand and add the start and current end to the result.

```java
    // define OPEN and CLOSED event
    // they can be anything. But when encounter an OPEN we should + 1 and a CLOSED would be  -1
    // define the following would save an if - clause
    private final int OPEN = 1;
    private final int CLOSED = -1;
    public int[][] merge(int[][] intervals) {
        // break intervals into events
        int[][] states = new int[2 * intervals.length][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < intervals.length; ++i) {
            //open event
            states[2 * i] = new int[] {intervals[i][0], OPEN};
            //closed event
            states[2 * i + 1] = new int[]{intervals[i][1], CLOSED};
        }
        // sort by timestamp. Note when the timestamp is the same, OPEN should go first for the intersection case
        // OPEN(1) > CLOSED(-1) so we need b[1] - a[1]
        Arrays.sort(states, (a, b) -> a[0] == b[0] ? b[1] - a[1] : a[0] - b[0]);
        
        ArrayList<int[]> list = new ArrayList<>();
        int count = 0;
        // -1 means we need record next start as all starts >= 0
        int start = -1;
        for (int[] state : states) {
            //record how many OPEN does not find a CLOSED.
            count += state[1];
            //record start if required
            if (start < 0) {
                start = state[0];
            }
            // ALL OPEN find matches. we need merge the intervals
            // the current state must be a CLOSED event for a legal input
            if (count == 0) {
                list.add(new int[]{start, state[0]});
                // ask to record next start
                start = -1;
            }
        }
        return list.toArray(new int[][]{});
    }
```

##### Sorting directly

 Actually for this problem, we can just sort the array directly. The important events is still a good method for solve many questions. But for this problem, sorting itself is good enough. We can sort by the start time and if the start time is the same, we can sort as the negative or reverse of the end time. The later is optional. It just reduce our operations on updating the end interval for the same start time.  By sorting in this way, we know the first met end time would be the largest end time among all intervals with the same start time. It won't change until a different / larger start time is met. When such start time appears. We can tell if it would be merge by checking if the current end time is greater or equal to the next start time. If yes, we can can merge them. During merge, there is nothing to make the intervals would end later than previous end. So we need to take the maximum of the two. If the next start time is greater than the end, we know we find a gap. We should start a new interval and close the current one.

```java
    public int[][] merge(int[][] intervals) {
        //sort by start time and then by reverse of end time
        //the first seen end time for a start time would be the max end time
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a,b) -> a[0] == b[0]? b[1] - a[1] : a[0] - b[0]);
        int start = intervals[0][0];
        int end = intervals[0][1];
        //record current start time in watch
        int prev = start;
        ArrayList<int[]> list = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; ++i) {
            int[] cur = intervals[i];
            //if it is current start time in watch, we can skip because we have the max end time in hand
            if (prev == cur[0]) {
                continue;
            }
            //update current start time in watch
            prev = cur[0];
            if (end >= cur[0]) {
                //if we can merge update the end time by the larger of the current and the next
               end = Math.max(end, cur[1]);
            } else {
                //we found a gap, close the current one and update the start and end.
               list.add(new int[]{start, end});
               start = cur[0];
               end = cur[1];
            }
        }
        list.add(new int[]{start, end});
        return list.toArray(new int[][]{});
    }
```

Time complexity: sorting O(nlogn) iteration O(n) -> O(nlogn)

Space complexity: Arrays.sort should double ended quicksort. it should be O(1) -> O(1).

##### Merge Sort

The name reminds the merge sort way of merging the intervals. We can break intervals into individual interval and merge them from bottom up.  For one interval array there is nothing to merge. For two interval arrays, first they should be already sorted by the start time during the previous merge (It is merge sort) and then we can find the small start time of the two. Again we would try to check the next start time exceeded the previous end time. If yes, we find a gap. Otherwise, we can merge the two intervals and update the end time if the next end time is larger. The whole idea is from merge sort. We just modify the assignment part. This solution would help  some hard question such as  [The_Skyline_Problem](../Divide_and_Conquer__Backtrack/06.The_Skyline_Problem.md).

```java
    public int[][] merge(int[][] intervals) {
        return mergeIntervals(intervals, 0, intervals.length - 1);
    }
    
    private int[][] mergeIntervals(int[][] intervals, int lo, int hi) {
        //nothing to divide, return the base case
        if (lo == hi) {
            return new int[][]{intervals[lo]};
        }
        //divde the two in half
        int mid = lo + (hi - lo)/2;
        int[][] left = mergeIntervals(intervals, lo, mid);
        int[][] right = mergeIntervals(intervals, mid + 1, hi);
        //merge two parts
        return merge(left, right);
    }
    
    private int[][] merge(int[][] left, int[][] right) {
        int leftIdx = 0;
        int rightIdx = 0;
        // window to record the start and end time in watch
        int[] window = new int[]{-1,-1};
        ArrayList<int[]> list = new ArrayList<>();
        // merge both
        while (leftIdx < left.length && rightIdx < right.length) {
            //find the smaller interval with small start for the two groups
            int[] cur = left[leftIdx][0] < right[rightIdx][0] ? left[leftIdx++] : right[rightIdx++];
            //check if we should start a new interval or merge
            checkAndMergeNewInterval(cur, list, window);
        }
        // check those left in the left group
        while (leftIdx < left.length) {
            int[] cur = left[leftIdx++];
            checkAndMergeNewInterval(cur, list, window);
        }
        // check those left in the right group
        while (rightIdx < right.length) {
            int[] cur = right[rightIdx++];
            checkAndMergeNewInterval(cur, list, window);
        }
        //add the last inspected group
        list.add(window);
        return list.toArray(new int[][]{});
        
    }
    
    private void checkAndMergeNewInterval(int[] cur, List<int[]> list, int[] window) {
        //check if the next start time is greater than the end time in watch
        if (cur[0] > window[1]) {
            // special process for the initial case. If it is not initial case, we should add the interval
            if (window[1] > -1) {
                list.add(new int[]{window[0], window[1]});
            }
            //update the start and end time
            window[0] = cur[0];
            window[1] = cur[1];
        } else if (cur[1] > window[1]){
            //if the next end is greater than the end in watch, update it.
            window[1] = cur[1];
        }
    }

## Employee Free Time

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/employee-free-time/)

We are given a list `schedule` of employees, which represents the working time for each employee.

Each employee has a list of non-overlapping `Intervals`, and these intervals are in sorted order.

Return the list of finite intervals representing **common, positive-length free time** for *all* employees, also in sorted order.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: schedule = [[[1,2],[5,6]],[[1,3]],[[4,10]]]
Output: [[3,4]]
Explanation:
There are a total of three employees, and all common
free time intervals would be [-inf, 1], [3, 4], [10, inf].
We discard any intervals that contain inf as they aren't finite.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: schedule = [[[1,3],[6,7]],[[2,4]],[[2,5],[9,12]]]
Output: [[5,6],[7,9]]
```

(Even though we are representing `Intervals` in the form `[x, y]`, the objects inside are `Intervals`, not lists or arrays. For example, `schedule[0][0].start = 1, schedule[0][0].end = 2`, and `schedule[0][0][0]` is not defined.)

Also, we wouldn’t include intervals like [5, 5] in our answer, as they have zero length.

**Note:**

1. `schedule` and `schedule[i]` are lists with lengths in range `[1, 50]`.
2. `0 <= schedule[i].start < schedule[i].end <= 10^8`.

### Solution

This problem can be viewed as a variant of the Merge_Intervals. We can first flat the 3-dimension int\[\]\[\]\[\] to int\[\]\[\] and merge the Intervals and then get the gap between intervals. If you want to solve this problem directly without merging fist. We can modify the "sorting with important events" solution to find the gaps only.

```java
    // define OPEN and CLOSED event
    // they can be anything. But when encounter an OPEN we should + 1 and a CLOSED would be  -1
    // define the following would save an if - clause
    private final int OPEN = 1;
    private final int CLOSED = -1;
     public List<Interval> employeeFreeTime(List<List<Interval>> avails) {
        List<int[]> states = new ArrayList<>();
        for (List<Interval> schedule : avails) {
            for (Interval interval : schedule) {
                states.add(new int[]{interval.start, OPEN});
                states.add(new int[]{interval.end, CLOSED});
            }
        }
        // sort by timestamp. Note when the timestamp is the same, OPEN should go first for the intersection case
        // OPEN(1) > CLOSED(-1) so we need b[1] - a[1]
        Collections.sort(states, (a, b) -> a[0] == b[0] ? b[1] - a[1] : a[0] - b[0]);
        
        ArrayList<Interval> list = new ArrayList<>();
        int count = 0;
        // -1 means we need record next start as all starts >= 0
        int start = -1;
        for (int[] state : states) {
            //record how many OPEN does not find a CLOSED.
            count += state[1];
            //record start if required
            if (start > 0) {
                list.add(new Interval(start, state[0]));
                start = -1;
            }
            // ALL OPEN find matches. we need merge the intervals
            // the current state must be a CLOSED event for a legal input
            if (count == 0) {
                start = state[0];
            }
        }
        return list;
    }
```
