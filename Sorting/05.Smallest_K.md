## Smallest K

Design an algorithm to find the smallest K numbers in the array. The K numbers can be in any order.

### Solution

This is a very interesting question. Actually, it could be a start of a system design problem.

#### Sorting directly

To solve this with least code, one might just call the function provided by the standard Java Library.

```java
public int[] smallestK(int[] arr, int k) {
    Arrays.sort(arr);
    return Arrays.copyOfRange(arr,0,k);
}
```

Time complexity: sorting O(nlogn) copy O(k) -> O(logn);

Space complexity: O(1);

But do we need to sort the whole array. Especially, it does not ask for the K numbers in sorting order.

Do we have anything similar to this question? It only asks for K numbers but in any order. You may find the percentile question.

To find an X-percentile in an array is a classic question as well. Like this question, we can sort the whole array to find it out. Or we can take advantage of quicksort/quickSelect. That provides O(n) time. The process of quicksort, would divide the array into two parts first. One is greater than pivot and the other is less than pivot. If we can the final index of pivot is K. Then we find the solution. 

### Quick Select

```java
   public int[] smallestK(int[] arr, int k) {
        return k == 0 || arr.length == 0 ? new int[0] : k == arr.length ? arr : quickFindSK(arr, 0, arr.length - 1, k);
    }

    private int[] quickFindSK(int[] arr, int start, int end, int k) {
        int pivot = arr[end];
        int i = start;
        int j = start;
        while (j < end) {
            if (arr[j] < pivot) {
                int temp = arr[i];
                arr[i++] = arr[j];
                arr[j] = temp;
            }
            j++;
        }
        arr[end] = arr[i];
        arr[i] = pivot;

        if (i > k) {
            return quickFindSK(arr, start, i - 1, k);
        } 
        if (i < k){
            return quickFindSK(arr, i + 1, end, k);
        } 
        int[] res = new int[k];
        for (int idx = 0; idx < k; ++idx) {
           res[idx] = arr[idx];
        }
        return res;
    }
```

Time complexity: O(n<sup>2</sup>) in the worst case but O(n) in0-average

Space complexity: O(1)

Even the question asks for sorted result. One can still perform the above approach and then sort the small array. In that case, sorting would O(klogk) instead of O(nlogn)

#### Heap/Priority Queue

The above solution is very efficient. This process the static data well. If we add one condition, the input is a dynamic like a stream. How do you find the K number at any a requested time? For dynamic data, we know binary search tree and priority queue are both find. As the question does not ask for the final data in order. We can just use Priority Queue. The TreeMap in java is actually red-black tree. so the insertion cost is high comparing to priority queue. And It does not allow duplicate keys. We have to maintain a count as the value in the map to reconstruct the result. So Priority Queue is a better choice. We can just maintain a max-priority queue with k elements and keep the K smallest numbers in the priority queue.

```java
   public int[] smallestK(int[] arr, int k) {
       if (k == 0 || arr.length == 0) {
           return new int[0];
       }
       if (k == arr.length) {
           return arr;
       }
       PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue(8, (a,b) -> b - a);
       for (int num : arr) {
           if (pq.size() < k) {
               pq.add(num);
           } else if (pq.peek() > num) {
               pq.pop();
               pq.add(num);
           }
       }
       int[] res = new int[k];
       int idx = 0;
       while(!pq.isEmpty()) {
           res[idx++] = pq.pop();
       }
    }
```

Time complexity O(klogk)

space complexity: pq O(k)

#### Merge sort

How about large dataset cannot be processed by one machine. We can try the Merge sort. Find out the smallest k in each section and merge the together.

```java
    public int[] smallestK(int[] arr, int k) {
        return k == 0 || arr.length == 0 ? new int[0] : mergeFindSK(arr, 0, arr.length - 1, k);
    }

    private int[] mergeFindSK(int[] arr, int start, int end, int k) {
        if (start == end) {
            return new int[]{arr[start]};
        }
        int mid = start + (end - start)/2;
        int[] left = mergeFindSK(arr, start, mid, k);
        int[] right = mergeFindSK(arr,mid + 1, end, k);
        return merge(left, right, k);
    }

    private int[] merge(int[] left, int[] right, int k) {
        int[] res = new int[Math.min(left.length + right.length, k)];
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        int idx = 0;
        while (i < left.length && j < right.length && idx < res.length) {
            if (left[i] < right[j]) {
                res[idx++] = left[i++];
            } else {
                res[idx++] = right[j++];
            }
        }

        while (i < left.length && idx < res.length) {
            res[idx++] = left[i++];
        }

        while (j < right.length && idx < res.length) {
            res[idx++] = right[j++];
        }
        return res;
    }
```

Time complexity: O(klogn) the depth is logn and in each merge we need iterate k times.

Space complexity: O(k)

Note, for distributed data. Merge sort is one approach. The other is to sort the data in small chunk and put the smallest value of each chunk in the heap. Get the smallest value of those values and add the second smallest value from the chunk where the smallest one is picked. Repeat this until k elements are found.
