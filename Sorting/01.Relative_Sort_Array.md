## Relative Sort Array

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/relative-sort-array/)

Given two arrays arr1 and arr2, the elements of arr2 are distinct, and all elements in arr2 are also in arr1.

Sort the elements of arr1 such that the relative ordering of items in arr1 are the same as in arr2. Elements that do not appear in arr2 should be placed at the end of arr1 in ascending order.

- `1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 1000`
- All the elements of `arr2` are **distinct**.
- Each `arr2[i]` is in `arr1`.

### Solution

At the first glance, It seems this problem can be resolved by customized comparator. We can have a map to map the element in arr2 and its index. If two elements are in the map, we compare their index. If only we of them is in the map, it is the smaller of the two. If neither of them are in the map, we compare them by natural order.

```java
    public int[] relativeSortArray(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < arr2.length; ++i) {
            map.put(arr2[i],i);
        }
       quickSort(arr1, 0, arr1.length - 1, map);
        return arr1;
        
    }
    
    private void quickSort(int[] arr1, int lo, int hi, Map<Integer, Integer> map) {
        if (lo >= hi) {
            return;
        }
        int pivot = partition(arr1, lo, hi, map);
        quickSort(arr1, lo, pivot - 1, map);
        quickSort(arr1, pivot + 1, hi, map);
        
    }
    
    private int partition(int[] a, int lo, int hi, Map<Integer, Integer> map) {
        int idx = lo;
        int pivot = a[hi];
        while (lo < hi) {
            if (compare(a[lo], pivot, map) < 0) {
                swap(a, idx++, lo);
            }
            lo++;
        }
        swap(a, idx, hi);
        return idx;
    }
    
    private void swap(int[] a, int i, int j) {
        int temp = a[i];
        a[i] = a[j];
        a[j] = temp;
    }
    
    private int compare(int a, int b, Map<Integer,Integer> map) {
        boolean containA = map.containsKey(a);
        boolean containB = map.containsKey(b);
        if (containA && containB) {
            return map.get(a) - map.get(b);
        } else if (containA)  {
            return -1;
        } else if (containB) {
            return 1;
        }
        
        return a - b;
    }
```

Time complexity: Average O(nlogn) the worst case O(n<sup>2</sup>)

Space complexity: the depth of recursion O(logn);

The above example is implemented with quicksort. Other sort algorithm like merge sort is also work.

However, this is not the best solution.  We have elements in arr2 are distinct and we need elements in arr1 to be sorted as in the same order as arr2 if they are in arr2 and natural order otherwise.  If we can pick the element in arr1 by the order of arr2, we can sort them in such way. And for the rest, we need the ability to pick them in natural order. To satisfy both, we can use counting sort. 

```java
    public int[] relativeSortArray(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {
        // elements are between 0 and 1000 inclusive
        int[] cnts = new int[1001];
        for (int a : arr1) {
            cnts[a]++;
        }
        int idx = 0;
        int[] res = new int[arr1.length];
        for (int a : arr2) {
            while (cnts[a]-- > 0) {
                res[idx++] = a;
            }
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < cnts.length; ++i) {
            while (cnts[i]-- > 0) {
                res[idx++] = i;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
```

Time complexity: O(n + m) where n and m are length of arr1 and arr2 respectively.

Space complexity: O(1) as the res[] is the return value so that is not counted and cnts is fixed array. You can use arr1 if the input can be modified.

But what if we have elements in large range?

If that case we can use a map instead of an array. Unless a TreeMap or NavigationMap is used, we cannot rely on the order of keys in the map. But lookup of a key would be O(logn). For LinkedHashMap, providing both O(1) lookup and performant iteration of entry, we would sort the unique values in arr1 with another sorting algorithm. Here we simply called the sorting function provided by standard library.

```java
    public int[] relativeSortArray(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {
        Map<Integer,Integer> cntMap = new LinkedHashMap<>();
        for (int a : arr1) {
            cntMap.merge(a, 1, (v1, v2) -> v1 + v2);
        }
        int idx = 0;
        int[] res = new int[arr1.length];
        //pick the element from the count by the order of arr2.
        for (int a : arr2) {
            int cnt = cntMap.get(a);
            while (cnt-- > 0) {
                res[idx++] = a;
            }
            //remove those cnt only leaves the unique element in arr1 left
            cntMap.remove(a);
        }
        // keep the idx for later sorting phase.
        int nextId = idx;
        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry: cntMap.entrySet()) {
            int val = entry.getKey();
            int cnt = entry.getValue();
             while (cnt-- > 0) {
                res[nextId++] = val;
            }
        }
        // sort the unique element in arr1
        Arrays.sort(res, idx, res.length);
        return res;
    }
```

Space complexity: O(n) n is the length of arr1
