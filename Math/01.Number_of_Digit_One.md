## Number of Digit One

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-digit-one/)

Given an integer n, count the total number of digit 1 appearing in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

Example 1:

Input: n = 13
Output: 6
Example 2:

Input: n = 0
Output: 0

### Solution
The BF way would be iterate all the number and check how many once in the digit but that is time consuming.

Let us check how many times one appears in a given place appears. One can be shown in digits in all places such as ones digit, tens digit, hundreds digit and so on as long as it is not exceeded n.

Let check tens digit for example. How many 1 at tens place are shown say when n = 12345. 
* 1. the 1 at tens place is shown as long as one hundred is added. so there are 123 hundreds to go over and it appears 123 times.
* 2. 1 is not all, 1 at tens place can also be its own after 12300. e.g. 12300 + 10 11, 12 .. 19.
  * a. if the digit at tens places is less than 1 (aka 0). no such 1
  * b. if the digit at tens is 1. The appears of 1 depends on the number on its right side. e.g 12 would mean the 1 at tens digit appears twice 10, 11, 12
  * c. if the digit at tens is greater than 1. all possible ones shown up. If it is 10, we have 10 additonal ones. If it is 100, we have 100 additional ones.

```java
    public int countDigitOne(int n) {
        if (n < 2) {
            return n;
        }
        if (n < 10) {
            return 1;
        }
        
        long res = 0;
        long base = 10;
        // check how many ith one appears
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
            long lead = n/base;
            long resid = n % base;
            //e.g 12345 the last 1 appears 1234 * 1 times for every 10, it shows once.
            //similarly the end last 1 appear 123 * 10 times every 100 it appears once
            res += lead * (base/10);
            // but that is not all. e.g In 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19. the 2nd last one also appears.
            //previously we only count 2nd once up to 12300. Those 12310 ... 12319 should also be counted. Similar to 12341, 12100 ..12199
            //if it is less than base/10, there we do not have such one in ith position
            // if it is greater than 2 * base/10. It appears base/10 times. 10..19 is 10 times.
            // if it is in between, we have n % (base) - base/10 + 1 times. e.g 156 would make the leading 1 57 times form 0 ~ 56.
            if (resid >= base/10) {
                res += resid < 2 * (base/10) ? resid - base/10 + 1 : base/10;
            }
            if (lead < 1) {
                break;
            }
            base *= 10;
            
        }
        return (int)res;
    }
