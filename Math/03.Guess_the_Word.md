## Guess the Word

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-the-word/)

This is an interactive problem.

You are given an array of unique strings wordlist where wordlist[i] is 6 letters long, and one word in this list is chosen as secret.

You may call Master.guess(word) to guess a word. The guessed word should have type string and must be from the original list with 6 lowercase letters.

This function returns an integer type, representing the number of exact matches (value and position) of your guess to the secret word. Also, if your guess is not in the given wordlist, it will return -1 instead.

For each test case, you have exactly 10 guesses to guess the word. At the end of any number of calls, if you have made 10 or fewer calls to Master.guess and at least one of these guesses was secret, then you pass the test case.


#### Solution

The simple way to find the word is to to iterate over the word list and call the guess function with each word to find the correct answer. But that would be at most n calls to the guess function and the question is only allow 10 guesses. How can we reduce the call to the guess function. Of course, we need to at least made one call to get some information about the target. If we make one call, what are the possible return values?

0 -> no character is at the correct position
1 -> 1 character is at the correct position
...
6 -> all characters is at the correct position

If we get 6, the target word is found. But what if we get others? It, at least, tells how many characters are exactly the same as the target word. So we can use this information to check the rest of words to see if we can get the same score when compare to the other word. For other word that is not satisfy the score (higher or lower), they should be discarded.

```java
/**
 * // This is the Master's API interface.
 * // You should not implement it, or speculate about its implementation
 * interface Master {
 *     public int guess(String word) {}
 * }
 */
    public void findSecretWord(String[] wordlist, Master master) {
        // although the question said the list is unique but it won't pass if we do not remove duplicates...
        List<String> words = new LinkedList(new HashSet<String>(Arrays.asList(wordlist)));
        while (!words.isEmpty()) {
            Iterator<String> wIt = words.iterator();
            String cand = wIt.next();
            // remove the current guess word in the list
            wIt.remove();
            // find the score
            int target = master.guess(cand);
            // check the current word is the target word
            if (target == 6) {
                return;
            }
            // remove all other word that does not have the same score
            while (wIt.hasNext()) {
                if (target != score(cand, wIt.next())) {
                    wIt.remove();
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    private int score(String a, String b) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < a.length(); ++i) {
            if (a.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i)) {
                res++;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
```
