## Minimum Difference Between Largest and Smallest Value in Three Moves

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difference-between-largest-and-smallest-value-in-three-moves/)

You are given an integer array nums. In one move, you can choose one element of nums and change it by any value.

Return the minimum difference between the largest and smallest value of nums after performing at most three moves.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,3,2,4]
Output: 0
Explanation: Change the array [5,3,2,4] to [2,2,2,2].
The difference between the maximum and minimum is 2-2 = 0.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,5,0,10,14]
Output: 1
Explanation: Change the array [1,5,0,10,14] to [1,1,0,1,1]. 
The difference between the maximum and minimum is 1-0 = 1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
-10<sup>9</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup>


### Solution

There are at most 3 moves. Clearly, it nums.length < 5. The difference is 0 because we can change them to one number.

For the rest cases, how to get the min difference? At most three moves are allowed, and we are looking for the max difference in the array. Clearly, we need to make the max and the min closer to each other after the change. We only have 3 moves, it can only change 3 elements. To minimize the difference. It would be either the first smallest elements, the first two smallest elements and the largest element, the smallest elements and the first two largest elements + first three elements.

For each case, the max difference is between 
1. the largest element and the fourth smallest element
2. the second largest element and the third smallest element 
3. the third largest element and the second smallest element
4. the fourth largest element and the smallest element

So, we can sort the array and compare the four candidates and find the minimiun difference.

```java
    public int minDifference(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length < 5) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        return Math.min( Math.min(nums[nums.length - 1] - nums[3], nums[nums.length-2] - nums[2]), Math.min(nums[nums.length-3] - nums[1], nums[nums.length-4] - nums[0]));
    }

```
Time complexity: Sort => O(nlog(n));
Space complexity: O(1)

To find the those eight elements, one can also use two PriorityQueue (min heap + max heap). That would give O(nlog(4)) => O(n) performance. But every time we do need convert int to Integer.

```java
    public int minDifference(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length < 5) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();
        PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(5, (a, b) -> b - a);
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            minHeap.add(num);
            maxHeap.add(num);
            
            if (minHeap.size() > 4) {
                minHeap.poll();
                maxHeap.poll();
            }
        }
        
        // sort small part in nature order
        int[] small = new int[4];
        for (int i = 3 ; i >= 0; --i) {
            small[i] = maxHeap.poll();
        }
        
        int res = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int id = 0;
        while (!minHeap.isEmpty()) {
            res = Math.min(res, minHeap.poll() - small[id++]);
        }
        
        return res;
    }
```
