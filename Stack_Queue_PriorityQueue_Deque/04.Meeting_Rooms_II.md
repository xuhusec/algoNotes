## Meeting Rooms II

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-ii/)

Given an array of meeting time intervals *intervals* where *intervals[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>]*, return the minimum number of conference rooms required.

### Sort + PriorityQueue

The minimum number of conference room is equal to the max number of meetings that overlapped from the mini start time and the max end time.
The question become finding the that number. When a meeting overlap with another meeting? That is that end time of meeting A is between the start time of meeting B and the end time of meeting B. Also, it should strictly greater than the start time of meeting B, and it can be equal to the end time of meeting B.
So, we need to check both the start time and end time. In this case we can sort the array by start time and use PriorityQueue to process the end time after sorting.

```java
 public int minMeetingRooms(int[][] intervals) {
    if (intervals == null || intervals.length == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
    PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
    pq.add(intervals[0]);
    int res = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; ++i) {
        int[] interval = intervals[i];
        if (pq.peek()[0] <= interval[0]) {
            res = Math.max(res, pq.size());
            pq.clear()
        } else {
            pq.add(interval);
        }
    }
    return Math.max(res, pq.size());
 }
```
