## Trapping Rain Water II

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water-ii/)

Given an m x n integer matrix heightMap representing the height of each unit cell in a 2D elevation map, return the volume of water it can trap after raining.

### Soluition

#### PQ + BFS

When the water flows instead of the matrix. It must heigher than the lowest boundary cells. As the height of water grows, it can reach more cells. When the height of the cells is less than the height of water. The water is trapped. So we need to search from the boundary. The first cell allows water to be flown in must be the one with lowest height in the  boundary. From that time, all the cells adjcent to that lowest boundary cell become boundaries if they not already be one. And water flows to the lowest cells with previous boundaries and newly added boundaries because of flows to the lowest boundary point. Repeat this process would find the order of cells being flowed by water. When the cells height is less than current water  height. The water is trapped.

So we need the Priority Queue to track the height of lowest boundary and BFS to find new boundaries after the lowest boundary being covered by water.

As said previouly, at the begining the boundary should be added to the PQ because the water start to invade from outside.

        final int N = heightMap[0].length;
        
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(M*N, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[M][N];
        // add boundaries, where first leak happens
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {

        }
        int res = 0;
        int level = 0;
        // BFS to find next boundaries
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            int[] cur = pq.poll();
            if (cur[0] > level) {
                level = cur[0];
            }
            res += level - cur[0];
            
            for (int[] dir : DIRS) {
                int x = cur[1] + dir[0];
                int y = cur[2] + dir[1];
                if (x < 0 || x >= M || y < 0 || y >= N || visited[x][y]) {
                    continue;
                }
                visited[x][y] = true;
