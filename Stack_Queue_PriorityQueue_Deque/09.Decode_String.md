## Decode String

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-string/)

Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.

The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

You may assume that the input string is always valid; there are no extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there will not be input like 3a or 2[4].

#### Solution

As we can see, it is possible to have nested []. So it requires to track them. One way is to track it with recursive calls. Another is to simulate this process with stack. Once there is a [], according to the statement, there must be integer in right before "[" and if there is an integer, a "[" must behind the number. So we can use two stack to track them. One is for integer/number and the other is for the generated string. In java, String operation is costly because of the String is immutable and concatenation would create a new string which is O(n). So we keep track StringBuilder object.
Every time "[" is met, there must be a number in front of it. So that number would be put in the number stack and the StringBuilder should be put in the StringBuilder stack and create a StringBuilder to continue. Repeat this process for nested "[". When a "]" is met, the StringBuilder and the number is popped from the stacks. The pop out StringBuilder should append current string builder in popped number times. Repeat this process.    

```java
    public String decodeString(String s) {
        Deque<Integer> cntStack = new ArrayDeque<>();
        Deque<StringBuilder> stringStack = new ArrayDeque<>();
        int cnt = 0;
        StringBuilder cur = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i) {
            char ch = s.charAt(i);
            if (Character.isDigit(ch)) {
                cnt = cnt * 10 + (ch - '0');
            } else if (Character.isLetter(ch)) {
                cur.append(ch);
            } else if (ch == '[') {
                cntStack.push(cnt);
                cnt = 0;
                stringStack.push(new StringBuilder(cur));
                cur.setLength(0);
            } else if (ch ==']') {
                StringBuilder prev = stringStack.pop();
                int size = cntStack.pop();
                while (size-- > 0) {
                    prev.append(cur);
                }
                cur = prev;
            }
        }
        return cur.toString();
    }
```

Time complexity: O(mn) where m is the max number and n the length
Space Complexity: O(n)

The following a recursive version.

```java
    public String decodeString(String s) {
        return decodeString(s, new Info()).toString();
    }
    public StringBuilder decodeString(String s, Info info) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        int cnt = 0;
        while (info.id < s.length()) {
            char ch = s.charAt(info.id++);
            if (Character.isDigit(ch)) {
                cnt = cnt * 10 + (ch - '0');
            } else if (Character.isLetter(ch)) {
                sb.append(ch);
            } else if (ch == '[') {
                StringBuilder next = decodeString(s, info);
                while (cnt > 0) {
                    cnt--;
                    sb.append(next);
                }
            } else {
                return sb;
            }
        }
        return sb;
    } 

    private static class Info {
        private int id;
    }
