### Stack and Queue

Stack would help to solve questions related to most recent unchecked/unprocessed values.

Queue: align with insert order (e.g BFS search)



How to implement Queue only with Stack?

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/)

1. create two stacks
2. Put all the elements in one of the stacks
3. Take all the elements form the stack and put into another stack

The seconds stack would act as a Queue for original order. When a new element to be added. All the elements in the second queue should be added back to the first one.

One can also implement Stack only with Queue?

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-stack-using-queues/)

One way to implement this is to have two Queues. For peek() and pop(), take all the elements except the last element to the other queue. Depending on peek() or pop(), the last will or will not be added to the other queue. switch two queues. Then elements can be always added to a specific queue (say the first of them) and empty would only check one queue.

### Priority Queue (Priority Heap)

In general, this data structure is called heap (Note: this is different from heap in Java Memory Model). Priority Queue or Priority Heap is usually to deal with the dynamic data.  In Java, Priority Queue implementation is based on balanced binary heap. For ease of discussion, we would talk about a max heap  in which the maximum element is on the top and a min heap would be similar. The only thing guaranteed is that no decedents (all the nodes in the left and right subtrees) of a node is greater than the node. Unlike Binary search tree with negative comparator (to match the max heap), all the nodes in the right subtree is smaller than its left tree (normally it would be larger but we use negative comparator).  The nodes in the left may or may not be larger than a node in the right subtree. The following is an example of heap in tree presentation.

![max heap example](image\max_heap.png)

Balanced binary Heap is usually stored as a full binary tree. In each row, a node would be filled only when all the left nodes are filled. In above image, 20 (10th) can not be a children of 8 (6th) or 1 (7th) because 26 (5th) still have children to fill. It is also cannot be right child of 26 because its left node needs to be filled first. A benefit of full binary tree is the it can be represented in an array and if the root of the binary tree is at pos1 (not 0!). Then new node fills the the rest in order. Then for any node, its parent is \<its pos\>/2 and its children is \<its pos\> * 2 and  \<its pos\> * 2 + 1. 

Adding: a new node is added, it would compare with its parent, if the parent is larger than its value. This current position is the correct position of current node. If its parent is less than its value, than swap this two and continue to to compare with its new parent until finding a large parent or reaching the top. 

Removing the max element: after removing the max element, an element should be fill its position. The last node (This can be saved in pos 0) would be moved to the top and compare with its children. if a children is larger than it, swap them repeat this process until no larger children is found.

Application

Heap sort. The heap is always provide max or min value of the rest of the elements. A heap sort is to pick up every elements through the heap to get an order collection. But for balanced binary heap, the relative order of data is changed during adding and picking the top. For a fixed set of data, it would need more swaps than other efficient sorting algorithm such as quicksort. And The index is 1 -> 2 -> 4 ->8 etc. for adding and picking the top, this is not friendly for CPU cache (it works better with consecutive data). So, you might prefer efficient sorting to heap sort. However, for dynamic input, insert an element in an array is O(n) while, it only takes O(logn) for heap.

Top K elements: There are many solutions for top k elements. The most efficient way so far is [BFPRT Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_of_medians). This problem can also be solved with heap. heap works well with dynamic data set. The application of top K elements is like top trend in twitter of last hour etc. For heap, we would have a min heap of size k, fill the heap if its size is less than k. After that, if the top of heap is less than the current elements, remove the top and add the new element. The heap contains all top k elements. This could also help with x percentile. We can have two heaps. One max heap and one min heap. Based on current seen elements, we can calculate how many elements should be in each heap. The max heap would store all the elements less than x percentile and the min heap store all elements greater or equal to the x percentile. For each element, it would compare to the top of max heap, if it is less than or equal to the top, the element would be added to the max heap. Otherwise, it would be added to the min heap. If the size of two heap does not satify the percentage requirement, we move the top of the one exceed the size to the other. Of course, for a fixed set of data, sorting is better but for dynamic data, heap works great.

### Deque

Deque supports both Queue and Stack supports. Besides such those, deque can also apply to the sliding window algorithm because it is easy to remove in the front and add in the back.
