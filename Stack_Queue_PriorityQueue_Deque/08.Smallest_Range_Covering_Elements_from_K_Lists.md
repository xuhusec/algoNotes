## Smallest Range Covering Elements from K Lists

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-range-covering-elements-from-k-lists/)

You have k lists of sorted integers in **non-decreasing order**. Find the **smallest** range that includes at least one number from each of the k lists.

We define the range [a, b] is smaller than range [c, d] if b - a < d - c or a < c if b - a == d - c.

#### Solution

To find the smallest range, we need first have a range to cover all the k lists. In the beginning, this should be the min value and the max value among all the first elements in those k lists. The final range must contains the element in the list with small elements. To find if there is any better solution, we can remove the smallest elements in the current range and add its next element into consideration. The next element might be
1. the smallest element
2. the largest element
3. between smallest and largest

the new range would be the new smallest element in those k elements and the largest elements in those k elements. Then, we can repeat this steps until reaching end of a list. We cannot go further because that means that very list would not be covered. Because the next element of the list with small current element could be the largest element, we need update the max. 

How about the smallest element among the k element? Because it is dynamically changed, Priority Queue could be a good choice. Of course, a TreeSet might also works but we only need to smallest instead of sorting every elements.

```java
    public int[] smallestRange(List<List<Integer>> nums) {
        int[] res = new int[2];
        int len = -1;
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(nums.size(), (a,b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        // add the first element in every list to the PriorityQueue and keep track the max
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            int num = nums.get(i).get(0);
            max = Math.max(num, max);
            pq.add(new int[]{num, i, 0});
        }
        // set initial range the smallest and the largest
        res[0] = pq.peek()[0];
        res[1] = max;
        len = res[1] - res[0];
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            int[] cur = pq.poll();
            // if we reach the end, we should stop
            if (nums.get(cur[1]).size() == cur[2] + 1) {
                break;
            }
            // get the next element to be added after removing the smallest element
            int[] cand = new int[]{nums.get(cur[1]).get(cur[2] + 1), cur[1], cur[2] + 1};
            // update the max if applicable
            max = Math.max(cand[0], max);
            // adding new element to the priorityQueue
            pq.add(cand);
            // get the new min among the k elements
            int min = pq.peek()[0];
            // check if we found a small range
            if (max - min < len) {
                res[0] = min;
                res[1] = max;
                len = max - min;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
```

Time Complexity: pq O(mnlogn) where m is number of element in a list and n is number of list. iteration n lists for initial set up and in the worst case visited all the elements except the last one in every list => (mnlogn)
Space Complexity: pq O(n)
