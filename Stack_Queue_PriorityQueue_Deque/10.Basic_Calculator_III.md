## Basic Calculator III

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator-iii/)

Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.

The expression string contains only non-negative integers, '+', '-', '*', '/' operators, and open '(' and closing parentheses ')'. The integer division should truncate toward zero.

You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of [-231, 231 - 1].

Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval().


#### Solution

This is the third installment of Basic Calculator question. Let us start with Basic Calculator II and the difference is no parenthesises in the expression.
For Basic Calculator II question. This can be resolved by Stack. You can either use one stack or two stacks. 

For the two stacks solution. Each number is pushed to one stack and the operator is pushed to the stack stack. Once a new number is extracted from the express, the last operator should be examed. If that operator is "+" or "-", the new element should be pushed to the stack and check the rest of the expression. This is because if the next operator is "\*" or "/", we should evaluate them first. If that operator is "\*" or "/". we need evaluate last number in the stack, the last operator in the operator stack and the new number. And then remove them from the stack and push the result to the number/operand stack. This is because "\*" and "/" has higher priority and because we do not add parethesis yet. The future "\*" and "/" has lower priority than the current one. And the end of the iteration, the only operators left in the stack is "+" and "-" and we can evaluate them based on Commutative property.

For the one stack solution, it is the same idea. But we only keep track the last operator. If the last operator is "\*" and "/", it would be evaluated immediately. For "+" and "-", the number is pushed to the stack. However, we need a trick for "-", because "- a" is equal to "+ (-a)". So for "-", the negative number is pushed to the stack. In that case, no need to track sign in a separate stack.

```java
    public int calculate(String s) {
        Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
        int cur = 0;
        char operator = '+';
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i) {
            char ch = s.charAt(i);
            if (ch == ' ') {
                continue;
            }
            if (Character.isDigit(ch)) {
                cur = cur * 10 + (ch - '0');
            } else {
                operation(stack, operator, cur);
                cur = 0;
                operator = ch;
            }
        }
        operation(stack, operator, cur);
        int res = 0;
        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            res += stack.pop();
        }
        return res;
    }
    
    private void operation(Deque<Integer> stack, char operator, int cur) {
        if (operator == '+') {
            stack.push(cur);
        } else if (operator == '-') {
            stack.push(-cur);
        } else if (operator == '*' ) {
            stack.push(stack.pop() * cur);
        } else if (operator == '/') {
            stack.push(stack.pop()/cur);
        }
    }
```
Time complexity: iterate string and push and pop in the stack O(n)
Space complexity: track numbers in the stack O(n)

Let us go back to the Basic Calculator III. From II to III, the only difference is to add parenthesis. Once the parenthesis is added. the expression inside of the parenthesis should be evaluated first. And the expression inside of the parethesis is also a valid expression. Do you see the recurisive nature here. The solution is the similar to Basic Calculator II but when a "(" is met, a recursive function call is made. the recurisive function is existed when the corresponing ")" shows up. And within each pair parenthesis it is the same proceduare as evaluate the whole expression.

```java
    public int calculate(String s) {
        return calculate(s, 0)[0];
        
    }
    
    private int[] calculate(String s, int idx) {
        Deque<Integer> operands = new ArrayDeque<>();
        char lastOpt = '+';
        int cur = 0;
        while (idx < s.length()) {
            char ch = s.charAt(idx++);
            if (Character.isDigit(ch)) {
                cur = cur * 10 + (ch - '0');
                continue;
            }
            if (ch == '(') {
                // make a recursive call
                int[] info = calculate(s, idx);
                idx = info[1];
                cur = info[0];
            } else if (ch == ')') {
                // exist the recursive call
                pushLast(operands, cur, lastOpt);
                cur = 0;
                while (!operands.isEmpty()) {
                    cur += operands.pop();
                }
                return new int[]{cur, idx};
            } else {
                pushLast(operands, cur, lastOpt);
                cur = 0;
                lastOpt = ch;
            }
        }
        pushLast(operands, cur, lastOpt);
        cur = 0;
        while (!operands.isEmpty()) {
            cur += operands.pop();
        }
        return new int[]{cur, idx};
        
    }
    private void pushLast(Deque<Integer> operands, int cur, char lastOpt) {
        if (lastOpt == '+') {
            operands.push(cur);
        } else if (lastOpt == '-') {
            operands.push(-cur);
        } else if (lastOpt == '*') {
            operands.push(operands.pop() * cur);
        } else {
            operands.push(operands.pop() / cur);
        }
    }
