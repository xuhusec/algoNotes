## Alphabet Board Path

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/alphabet-board-path/)

On an alphabet board, we start at position (0, 0), corresponding to character board[0][0].

Here, board = ["abcde", "fghij", "klmno", "pqrst", "uvwxy", "z"], as shown in the diagram below.

| a | b | c | d | e |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| f | g | h | i | j |
| k | l | m | n | o |
| p | q | r | s | t |
| u | v | w | x | y |
| z |   |   |   |   |

We may make the following moves:

'U' moves our position up one row, if the position exists on the board;
'D' moves our position down one row, if the position exists on the board;
'L' moves our position left one column, if the position exists on the board;
'R' moves our position right one column, if the position exists on the board;
'!' adds the character board[r][c] at our current position (r, c) to the answer.
(Here, the only positions that exist on the board are positions with letters on them.)

Return a sequence of moves that makes our answer equal to target in the minimum number of moves.  You may return any path that does so.

#### Solution

To solve this quesition, we can calcualte the difference in X-axis and the difference int Y-axis. If on X, the differnce is positive. We can append "R". Otherwise, append "L". Similarly, for Y-axis, "U" are "D" are appended accordingly.

But there is a catch. Please note the last row in the quesiton has only one cell. And one cannot stop in the the empty area. So, we can specify order to avoid this problem. Note, the case of visiting to the empty cell. It requires changes in X-axis and changes in Y-axis. For example, from z to q. We need to changes Y-axis first. Otherwise, moving to the right would requires visitng the empty cell. Simliarly, from w to z. That requires changes X first. So, we can find some rules here. When we need going up, we change Y first. Otherwise, we change X-axis.

```java
    public String alphabetBoardPath(String target) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        int x = 0;
        int y = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < target.length(); ++i) {
            int id = target.charAt(i) - 'a';
            int nX = id / 5;
            int nY = id % 5;
            int diffX = nX - x;
            int diffY = nY - y;
            if (diffX > 0) {
                moveY(sb, diffY);
                moveX(sb, diffX);
            } else {
                moveX(sb, diffX);
                moveY(sb, diffY);
            }
            
            sb.append('!');
            
            x = nX;
            y = nY;
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
    
    private void moveX(StringBuilder sb, int step) {
        if (step > 0) {
            appendInstruction(sb, step, 'D');
        } else if (step < 0) {
            appendInstruction(sb, -step, 'U');
        }
    }
    
    private void moveY(StringBuilder sb, int step) {
        if (step > 0) {
            appendInstruction(sb, step, 'R');
        } else if (step < 0) {
            appendInstruction(sb, -step, 'L');
        }
    }
    
    private void appendInstruction(StringBuilder sb, int val, char in) {
        while (val-- > 0 ) {
            sb.append(in);
        }
        
    }
