## Text Justification

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/text-justification/)

Given an array of strings words and a width maxWidth, format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left-justified and no extra space is inserted between words.

Note:

A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.
The input array words contains at least one word.

### Solution

This problem most likely checks only the coding skill. I have no found any fancy way to resolve this question. The logic is as follow.
We can have two list. One is the final result. The other is currently examed word. We need the second list because we do not know how many spaces to put between words until we know how many words in a line. 
If everything goes well, every two words would form "word1" + " " + "word2". we can keep track the len until adding new word would make the length exceeds the maxium. For each new word in the line, we need add a space and the word itself. In this case, the increment would be 1 + the length of the word. This holds true for every word in the line except the first one. So, we can have a small trick by seting the length to -1 in the begining of each line. So that we can keep the logic accross the line. 

After figure out the how many words in the line, it is possible to calculate the spaces between word. if the sentence just fit (the length is equal to the maxWidth) we just append word and following a space except the last word which no extra space is needed. Otherwise, the extra space should be distributed access the (n - 1) spaces created by n words. And according to the question. The left would be assigned more spaces. Of course, if there is only one word in the sentence, (n-1) would zero and we actually only need to put spaces after the first word without calculation.

Finally the last line should be treated sepcially as required by the question. we just process it as if it fits the maxWidth and put extra spaces at the end.

    public List<String> fullJustify(String[] words, int maxWidth) {
        List<String> res = new LinkedList<>();
        Deque<String> cur = new LinkedList<>();

        for (String word : words) {
            int nextLen = curLen + word.length() + 1;
            if (nextLen == maxWidth) {
                StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
                while (!cur.isEmpty()) {
                    sb.append(cur.removeFirst()).append(' ');
                }
                sb.append(word);
                res.add(sb.toString());
                curLen = -1;
            } else if (nextLen < maxWidth) {

                curLen = nextLen;
            } else {

                if (cur.size() == 1) {
                    res.add(cur.removeFirst() + " ".repeat(resid));
                } else {
                    int cnt = cur.size();
                    int spaces = resid/(cnt-1);
                    int remine = resid - (spaces * (cnt - 1));
                    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

                            sb.append(" ");
                            remine--;
                        }
                        sb.append(" ".repeat(spaces + 1));

            sb.append(cur.removeFirst());

            }
            if (sb.length() < maxWidth) {
                sb.append(" ".repeat(maxWidth - sb.length()));
            }
            res.add(sb.toString());
            
        }
        return res;
    }
