## Assign Cookies

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/)

Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child `i` has a greed factor `g[i]`, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie `j` has a size `s[j]`. If `s[j] >= g[i]`, we can assign the cookie `j` to the child `i`, and the child `i` will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

### Solution

A child would be content with a cookie is the size of cookie is greater or equal to his/her greedy factor, i.e. s[j] >= g[i]. If we focus on the greedy factor, we should give the large size to the child with the largest greedy factor that less than or equal to the size. 

```java
    public int findContentChildren(int[] g, int[] s) {
        Arrays.sort(s);
        Arrays.sort(g);
        
        int i = s.length - 1;
        int j = g.length - 1;
        int res = 0;
        while (i >= 0 && j >= 0) {
            if (s[i] >= g[j]) {
                i--;
                res++;
            } 
            j--;
        } 
        return res;
    }
```

Time complexity: the sorting prevails over iteration -> O(nlogn+mlogm) where n is g.length and m is s.length

Space complexity: Java uses Dual-Pivot Quicksort O(1)

Of course, you can also focus on the size. Because there is no difference between satisfying a small greedy factor and a large greedy factor. We can just try to assign cookie as long as a child can be satisfied.  

```java
    public int findContentChildren(int[] g, int[] s) {
        Arrays.sort(s);
        Arrays.sort(g);
        
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        int res = 0;
        while (i < s.length && j < g.length) {
            if (s[i] >= g[j]) {
                j++;
                res++;
            } 
            i++;
        } 
        return res;
    }
```
