## Lemonade Change


[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/lemonade-change/)

At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs \$5. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you, and order one at a time (int the order specified by bills). Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either \$5, \$10 or \$20 bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the next transaction is that the customer pays \$5.

Note that you don't have any change in hand at first.

Given a integer array bills where bills[i] is the bill the i^th^ customer pays, return true if you can provide every customer with correct change, or false otherwise.

### Solution

This can be viewed as a simplified knapsack/coin change problem. It is simplified because the 5, 10 and 20 are in a sequence that each element is a multiple of all previous elements. The result of this is that we need to use the higher bill first.

For a \$20 bill, the changes would be a \$10 bill and a $5 bill or 3 \$5 bills.

For a $10 bill, the change would be a \$5 bill.

So for a \$20 bill, we would return a \$10 bill if we have one so that we can save \$5 for those \$10 bills.

```java
    public boolean lemonadeChange(int[] bills) {
        int cntFive = 0;
        int cntTen = 0;
        for (int bill : bills) {
            if (bill < 10) {
                //paid with $5
                cntFive++;
            } else if (bill < 20) {
                //paid with $10
                // need to take a $5 if there is any
                if (cntFive-- < 1) { return false; }
                cntTen++;
            } else {
                // we need at least one $5
                if (cntFive < 1) { return false; }
                if (cntTen > 0 ) {
                    //if there is $10 bill use it first
                    cntFive--;
                    cntTen--;
                } else if (cntFive > 2){
                    // return 3 $5 bill
                    cntFive -= 3;
                } else {
                    // not enough bills for change e.g. 2 $10s won't work
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
```

Time complexity: go through the array -> O(n)

Space complexity: O(1)
