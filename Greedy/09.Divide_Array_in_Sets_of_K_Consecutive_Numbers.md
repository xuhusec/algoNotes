## Divide Array in Sets of K Consecutive Numbers

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-array-in-sets-of-k-consecutive-numbers/)

Given an array of integers nums and a positive integer k, check whether it is possible to divide this array into sets of k consecutive numbers.

Return true if it is possible. Otherwise, return false.

#### Solution

 We need to check if k consecutive numbers can be found for each element. An element must be belong to one of the k consecutive number. Once we find an element, say a, we can try to find a + 1, a + 2, ..., a + k - 1. In order to checking it, we need to start from the minimum number and mark every used element. If any of them does not exist, we return false. Because of duplicated elements in the array. We can record the occurrence of every unique element in a map. This map can tells 1) if this element in the array is already be part of one or more k consecutive number (the value is 0); 2) if unmatched  a + 1, a + 2, ..., a + k - 1 exists. For all the elements in 2), every of their counts should be reduced by 1 so that they would not be matched by another group.

```java
    public boolean isPossibleDivide(int[] nums, int k) {
        // we need have multiple of k elements to in order to form k-element groups
        if (nums.length % k > 0) {
            return false;
        }
        // if k = 1, it is always true
        if (k == 1) {
            return true;
        }
        // sorting to make sure we start scan from smallest in the k-element group
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        // record counts
        Map<Integer,Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int num : nums) {
            map.merge(num, 1, (v1,v2) -> v1 + v2);
        }
        // greedily checking if all elements can be part of an k-consecutive-number group
        for (int num : nums) {
            // check if the current number is already in a group
            if (map.get(num) == 0) {
                continue;
            }
            // greedily explore k elements
            for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
                if (map.getOrDefault(num + i, 0) == 0) {
                    return false;
                }
                map.merge(num + i, -1, (v1, v2) -> v1 + v2);
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
