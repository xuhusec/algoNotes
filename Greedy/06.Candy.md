## Candy

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/)

There are n children standing in a line, Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

* Each child must have at least one candy
* Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return *the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children*

### Solution 

The second requirement is "Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors". This condition does not mean two children with the same rating as neighbors should be given the same number of candies. This can be clarified with the interviewer. So we only need to take care of neighbors with different ratings and make sure the higher one get more candies. This fits the greedy strategy. The only thing we would check are the neighbors. We can go through from the left to right and assign more candies (+1) if a rating is higher than previous one. After this iteration, all the left side are satisfied the requirement. Then we can go through another direction, but this time, we would take the higher value of the current value and candies of right neighbor with lower rating + 1. This would make sure both left and right neighbors satisfy the requirement.

```java
    public int candy(int[] ratings) {
        // intialize the candies array and assign every children with 1 candy
        int[] candies = new int[ratings.length];
        Arrays.fill(candies, 1);
        // loop from left and make sure all left neighbors with lower rating takes less candies
        for (int i = 1; i < candies.length; ++i) {
            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i-1]) {
                candies[i] = candies[i-1] + 1;
            }
        }
        //loop from right, to make sure all right neighbors with lower rating takes less candies
        // since after this iteration, the candies are met both requirements. We can get counts now.
        int sum  = candies[candies.length - 1];
        for (int i = candies.length - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
            // check if right neighbor has a lower rating and the neighbor has more or equal candies.
            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i+1] && candies[i] <= candies[i+1]) {
                //update candies to make sure this child has more candies than his/her lower rating neighor
                candies[i] = candies[i+1] + 1;           
            }
            sum += candies[i];
        }
        return sum;
    }
```
