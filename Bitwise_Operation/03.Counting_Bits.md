## Counting Bits

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/)

Given an integer n, return an array ans of length n+1 such that for each i (0 <= i <= n), ans[i] is the number of 1's in the binary representation of i. 

### Solution

This problem can be a follow up question of "Number of 1 Bits". Of course, the Brute Force solution would solve this question by calling the "Number of 1 Bits" n times (from 1 to n and we know for 0 there is no 1's).

But can we improve the solution. Then we need to find out the relations. between answers.  Can you calculate the number of 1's from the answer of existing/smaller integer. If yes, we can compute the answer from them instead of going through the whole bits again. As we know how to remove the last 1 bits from "Power of 2". It is n & (n - 1). By definition of removing the last 1 bits. That means the current number of 1's would be ans\[n&(n-1)\] + 1. And n & (n-1) < n. So we got our solution.

```java
    public int[] countBits(int n) {
        int[] ans = new int[n+1];
        if (n < 1) {
            return ans;
        }
        ans[1] = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i < ans.length; ++i) {
            ans[i] = ans[i&(i-1)] + 1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
```

Time complexity: O(n).

Space complexity: O(1).

If you think the above solution is tricky. We can try the following. Let's group the numbers by the range of power of 2. Why power of 2? Because at that point a new position that has not explored previously would be 1.

|      | number                | Remove newly added bit (the most significant bit) |
| ---- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 0    | 0                     | N/A                                               |
| 2^0^ | 1                     | 0                                                 |
| 2^1^ | 2, 3                  | 0,1                                               |
| 2^2^ | 4,5,6,7               | 0,1,2,3                                           |
| 2^3^ | 8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 | 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7                                   |

As you already can see from the last column. After removing the most significant bit. It is basic go over from the 0 to the end of last group again. That is right, the previous method is removing the last `1` bit. This method would remove the first `1` bit.  Now, we only need to track the the most significant bit. we know when the that is when double of it would be the current index, we should increase it. 

```java
    public int[] countBits(int n) {
        int[] ans = new int[n+1];
        if (n < 1) {
            return ans;
        }
        ans[1] = 1;
        int mSB = 1;
        int nextMSB = 2;
        for (int i = 2; i < ans.length; ++i) {
            if ( nextMSB == i) {
                mSB = nextMSB;
                nextMSB <<= 1;
            }
            ans[i] = ans[i - mSB] + 1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
```
