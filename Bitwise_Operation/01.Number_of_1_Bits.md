## Number of 1 Bits

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/)

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight)

**Note:**

- Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
- In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using [2's complement notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement). Therefore, the input,11111111111111111111111111111101 , represents the signed integer. `-3`.

### Solution

This is straight forward, we can just right shift n and check if the current lowest bit is 1. If yes, we count 1. Otherwise, we continue.  But as the question reminds the number might be negative. The normal right shift would not touch the first bit as the sign. We need to use the unsigned shift operator >>>. Note, this is specific for right shift. The left shift << can change the sign of the input.

```java
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int res = 0;
        while ( n != 0 ){
            res += n & 1;
            n >>>= 1;
        } 
        return res;
    }
```
