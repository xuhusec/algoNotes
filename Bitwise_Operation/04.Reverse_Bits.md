## Reverse Bits

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/)

Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

**Note:**

- Note that in some languages such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type. They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
- In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using [2's complement notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement). Therefore,  the input, 11111111111111111111111111111101, represents the signed integer `-3` and the output represents the signed integer `-1073741825`.

### Solution

Like the "Number of 1 bits", we need to last bit from the original number and append it to return. move the two numbers, the input and the return,  for next iteration. The input would unsigned shift right and the result would shift left. We can not stop when n is 0. In that case it is not reverse all the bits. those leading 0s should also be put at the tail section. So we need iterate over all 32 bits. One may find out when the input is zero and shift all the 0 together.

```java
    // you need treat n as an unsigned value
    public int reverseBits(int n) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; ++i) {
            res = (res << 1) | (n & 1);
            n >>>= 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
```

Time complexity: iterate over 32 O(1)

Space complexity: O(1)

```java
    // you need treat n as an unsigned value
    public int reverseBits(int n) {
        int res = 0;
        int i = 0;
        while (n != 0 && i++ < 32) {
            res = (res << 1) | (n & 1);
            n >>>= 1;
        }
        res <<= 32 - i;
        return res;
    }
```

Time complexity: iterate over all the bits after the leftmost 1 bit O(logn)

Space complexity: O(1)

Follow up question

1. We need to cache the result.
2. cache all numbers is not efficient and may not help much
3. We can cache the parts of the answer. For example cache the result every 3 bits, 4 bits, .. 16 bits etc. It is trade off of how many bits to cache. And reverse every X bits by looking up the cache. 

```java
    // you need treat n as an unsigned value
    // cache for 8bits
    private static int[] cache = new int[256];
    public int reverseBits(int n) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
            int key = n & 255; //(11111111)2
            res <<= 8;
            if (key > 0) {
                if (cache[key] < 1) {
                    cache[key] = reverse8Bits(key);
                }
                res |= cache[key];
            }
            n >>>= 8;
        }
        return res;
    }
    public int reverse8Bits(int n) {
        int res = 0;
        int i = 0;
        while (n != 0 && i++ < 8) {
            res = (res << 1) | (n & 1);
            n >>>= 1;
        }
        res <<= 8 - i;
        return res;
    }
```
