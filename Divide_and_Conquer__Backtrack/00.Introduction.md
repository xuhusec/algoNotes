## Introduction

### Divide and Conquer

Divide and Conquer is a special case of recursion

A divide-and-conquer algorithm recursively breaks down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly, The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.

The above image shows the process. The original problem is kept to be broken down into sub-problems. In the above image, it only reaches two levels but, in real life, it may require more levels until the sub-problem is simple enough to be solved directly. 

Here is an example of divide and conquer

```java
public Object divideAndConquer(Object problem, Object param) {
    // terminator
    if (isSolvedDirectly(problem)) {
        //process the result
        return solve(problem, param);
    }
    //prepare data
    Object data = prepareData(problem, param);
    Object[] subproblems = split(problem, data);
    Object[] newParams = prepareParam(problem, param);
    //conquer subproblems
    Object subRes0 = divideAndConquer(subproblems[0], newParams[0]);
    Object subRes1 = divideAndConquer(subproblems[1], newParams[1]);
    ...
    // process and generate the final result
    Object res = processResults(subRes0, subRes1, ....);
    // revert the current level state if applicable
    
    return res;
}
```

### Backtracking

Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidates ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.

Backtracking can be applied only for problems which admit the concept of a "partial candidate solution" and a relatively quick test of whether it can possibly be completed a valid solution. It is useless, for example, for locating a given value in an unordered table. When it is applicable, however, backtracking is often much faster than brute-force enumeration of all complete candidates, since it can eliminate many candidates with a single test.

Backtracking is an important tool for solving constraint satisfaction problems, such as crosswords, verbal arithmetic, Sudoku, and many other puzzles. It is often the most convenient technique for parsing, for the knapsack problem and other combinatorial optimization problems.
