## Introduction

A hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

### Applications

* Telephone directory
* user info directory
* cache (e.g. LRU cache)
* key-value store (e.g. Redis)

### Hash Collisions

* Separate chaining
  Each bucket is independent, and has some sort of [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_(abstract_data_type)) of entries with the same index. The time for hash table operations is the time to find the bucket (which is constant) plus the time for the list operation.
* Open addressing
  All entry records are stored in the bucket array itself. When a new entry has to be inserted, the buckets are examined, starting with the hashed-to slot and proceeding in some *probe sequence*, until an unoccupied slot is found. 
* etc.

Java

| Type | Hash    | Red-black Tree |
| ---- | ------- | -------------- |
| Map  | HashMap | TreeMap        |
| Set  | HashSet | TreeSet        |

HashMap and HashSet provide O(1) lookup, insert and delete

TreeMap and TreeSet are based on binary search -> O(log(n))
