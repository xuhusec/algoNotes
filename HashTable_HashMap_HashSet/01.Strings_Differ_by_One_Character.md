## Strings Differ by One Character

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/strings-differ-by-one-character/)

Given a list of strings dict where all the strings are of the same length.

Return true if there are 2 strings that only differ by 1 character in the same index, otherwise return false.

Constraints:

The number of characters in dict <= 105
dict[i].length == dict[j].length
dict[i] should be unique.
dict[i] contains only lowercase English letters.

#### Solution

The BF solution would compare two strings in a nest loop and check if they differ by one character. That would be O(mn<sup>2</sup>) where m is the length of the string and n is the length of dictionary.

However, It is said the word in the dictionary is unique. This can help reduce the time complexity. Because each word is unique. It is possible to replace a character with a wildcard character, such as * , {, } etc. Then if another String can also form the same String by replacing one of its character with wildcard character. That is means it is possible. Because two strings are not the same, the replaced characters by wildcard must not be the same. 

```java
    public boolean differByOne(String[] dict) {
        Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (String s : dict) {
            char[] chars = s.toCharArray();
            for (int i = 0; i < chars.length; ++i) {
                char temp = chars[i];
                // replace the current character with wildcard
                chars[i] = '{';
                // check if that is already in the set and add it to the set
                if (!set.add(String.valueOf(chars))) {
                    return true;
                }
                //restore the string
                chars[i] = temp;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
```
Time Complexity: the nested loop is O(nm) and compose a string in java is O(m). => O(nm<sup>2</sup>)
Space Complexity: set would have all the replaced strings. each original string would derive m strings => O(mn)

The following up is to get answer for O(nm) time complexity. In java, the string object is immutable. So everytime, it costs O(m) to generate replaced string. It does not satisfy the requiremnt. Some language might be different. Rabin-Karp might be right choice.
