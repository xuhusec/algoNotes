## Valid Sudoku

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/)

Determine if a `9 x 9` Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated **according to the following rules**:

1. Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
3. Each of the nine `3 x 3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

**Note:**

- A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
- Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

### Solution

The requirement is clear. We need to track digits appears in each row, each column and each sub-boxes/block. To track them we can use set, boolean array or even an integer array. Because both set and boolean array would require 2 dimensions. we would use integer array here. This works because we only need 9 status where an integer can present 32 status with 32 bits. Each bit would tell if a digits has been seen in the row, column and block. The next question is how to tell which sub-boxes/or block we are currently checking. The intuitive way to number the blocks would be the following. We start from the upper left corner and give an index for every 3 * 3 blocks.

The next step would map the row and column to blocks. It would be Math.floor(row/3) * 3 + Math.floor(col/3). With Java int operation, this is equal to row / 3  * 3 + col / 3;

```java
    public boolean isValidSudoku(char[][] board) {
        final int N = board.length;
        final int M = board[0].length;
        // 9 rows, cols and blocks
        int[] rows = new int[9];
        int[] cols = new int[9];
        int[] blocks = new int[9];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < M; ++j) {
                if (board[i][j] == '.') {
                    continue;
                }
                // the mask for current number
                int mask = 1 << (board[i][j] - '0');
                //find id for blocks
                int blockId = mapToId(i,j);
                // if the digit is met before, we would have rows[i] & mask == mask. Otherwise, it is 0.
                // Similarly to cols[j] and blocks[blockId].
                // If the digit already met, this is not valid.
                if ((rows[i] & mask) > 0 || (cols[j] & mask) > 0 || (blocks[blockId] & mask) > 0) {
                    return false;
                }
                //record the digit info
                rows[i] |= mask;
                cols[j] |= mask;
                blocks[blockId] |= mask;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    // map row and column to block Id
    private int mapToId(int row, int col) {
        return row/3 *3 + col/3;
    }
```

Time complexity:  visiting all blocks O(mn) where m and n are # of columns and # of rows. For this problem it is fixed because it is 9 * 9.

Space complexity: three arrays O(n) where n == 9.

The description is the same as "Valid Sudoku". The '.' is undecided entry. We would like to find the correct digits to fill all '.'s. It is guaranteed that the input board has only one solution.

#### Solution

The Brute Force solution would try all possible solutions with backtrack and check if the solution is valid with the "Valid Sudoku". But that in the worst case would (9^9) ^9. We need to prune the redundant work. For example, if you already have a "1" in the row, you should not try to fill "1" in this row again. It is similar to columns and blocks. So we can try to limit the operations to try during the search instead of checking at the end.

First we can record what the problem already have specified. But make change in rows, cols and blocks array once a digit is met. Then we can start explore. For each options, i.e1- 9. We first check if there is any conflict. If no, we can record it in those three arrays as well. Then we can explore the next entry. If that success to fill all the entries, we get the answer. Otherwise, that means we should try another option. But please remember that we should restore all the status: rows, cols, blocks and '.' in the board so that we do not interfere with other paths.

We need a way to tell if all entries are filled legally. Hence, we would return a Boolean to indicate if a valid solution is found. 

```java
    public void solveSudoku(char[][] board) {
        int[] rows = new int[9];
        int[] cols = new int[9];
        int[] blocks = new int[9];
        //record the exisitng digits initially set in the board
        //those should not be changed in the following process
        recordExistsDigit(board, rows, cols, blocks);
        //solve with digit info
        solve(board, 0, 0, rows, cols, blocks);
        
    }
    
    private boolean solve(char[][] board, int r, int c, int[] rows, int[] cols, int[] blocks){
        // check if we already fill the entire board
        if (r == board.length) {
            return true;
        }
        // define int entry to explore
        int newR = r;
        int newC = c + 1;
        if (newC == board[r].length) {
            newR++;
            newC = 0;
        }
        //if it is a digit defined in the original puzzle, we can just check the next.
        if(Character.isDigit(board[r][c])) {
            return solve(board, newR, newC, rows, cols, blocks);
        }
        
        int blockId = mapToId(r,c);
        for (int i = 1; i <= 9; ++i) {
            // check if the current option is feasible
            int mask = 1 << i;
            if ((rows[r] & mask) > 0 || (cols[c] & mask) > 0 || (blocks[blockId] & mask) > 0){
                continue;
            }
            //try the current option
            rows[r] |= mask;
            cols[c] |= mask;
            blocks[blockId] |= mask;
            board[r][c] = (char) ('0' + i);
            //if the current option can be used to fill all the entire board,
            // we got the answer
            if (solve(board, newR, newC, rows, cols, blocks)) {
                return true;
            }
            // restore the status
            // board[r][c] should also be restored. 
            // for example we have board[1][2] and board[2][3] to be filled
            // if we do not restore, that would lead to wrong answer.
            // let's fill 1 to board[1][2] and explore. We found it does not work.
            // if we do not restore. board[2][3] would be left with the max option in last iteration.
            // Let's say 8. (9 is presented before)
            // but 8 might not the be correct digit to fill. That lead to a wrong answer.
            board[r][c] = '.';
            rows[r] ^= mask;
            cols[c] ^= mask;
            blocks[blockId] ^= mask;
        }
        // no valid solution found. return false
        return false;
    }
    
    private void recordExistsDigit(char[][] board, int[] rows, int[] cols, int[] blocks) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 9; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 9; ++j) {
                if (board[i][j] == '.') {
                    continue;
                }
                int mask = getMask(board[i][j]);
                rows[i] |= mask;
                cols[j] |= mask;
                blocks[mapToId(i,j)] |= mask;
            }
        }
    }
    private int getMask(char c) {
        return 1 << (c - '0');
    }
    private int mapToId(int row, int col) {
        return row / 3 * 3 + col / 3;
    }
```

Time complexity: Roughly it can be seen for each column or row. It would be 9! and we have 9 rows. 9*9!. Of course, it should be further narrow down.

Space complexity: the three arrays. That is 9.
