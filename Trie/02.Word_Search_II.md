## Word Search II

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search-ii/)

Given an m * n board of characters and a list of strings words, return all words on the board. 

Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.

- `board[i][j]` is a lowercase English letter.
- `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters
- All the strings of words are unique

### Solution

Any character on the board could be start of a word. As long as the same entry not being used more than once. We have a valid path to construct a word. To move on the board without repeating, we would use BFS and DFS. However, It is hard to track the parent with BFS. So DFS is a option. Let us try to start a word at a entry and explore all the valid paths to see if we can find a word. Of course, we need to avoid visiting the same entry twice. This could be a set but in java, the hash code of an array is its address. We can also set the character on board to a special character to avoid visiting it again. And we need to restore it after explore all the sub paths. So this is actually a backtrack.

The above solution works correctly. But it would perform bad. To enter each entry, we need to compare the string composed by all the characters up to now on the current path and the list of string. Although we can use Set to improve looking up in the list. That is still costly. Also maintain the String on the paths are also costly. And the final result should not contain duplicate words. We also need to remove string from the set after it being found on the board.

To improve this, we can use Trie or prefix tree. First, we can hold current node instead of a StringBuilder to track the composed string on the board. Also, once a prefix is not in the Trie. We can just stop searching. While the set cannot tell only with prefix. You may tell the maximum level dfs or backtrack could reach, i.e. the max length among all words. However, Trie would tell more, for example, you might have the word with maximum length 20 and no word startsWith abc. Then with Trie, once we have encounter "abc". We know it should be stopped but for set, we cannot tell and we would tell unless the length beyond 20. By introducing Trie, we could save a lot of time.

```java
    private static final int[][] DIRS = {{1,0},{-1,0},{0,1},{0,-1}};
    public List<String> findWords(char[][] board, String[] words) {
        Trie root = new Trie();
        // save all candidates to the Trie tree
        for (String word : words) {
            root.insert(word);
        }
        
        List<String> res = new LinkedList<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < board.length; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < board[0].length; ++j) {
                //try all possible start
                if (res.size() < words.length) {
                    //only explore when at least one candidates is not added to the list
                    backtrack(board, i,j, root, res);
                }
            }
        }
        
        
        return res;
    }
    
    private void backtrack(char[][] board, int row, int col, Trie cur, List<String> res) {
        if (row < 0 || row >= board.length || col < 0 || col >= board[0].length) {
            return;
        }
        if (board[row][col] == '\0'){
            // we mark the visited entry with null char \0.
            return;
        }
        Trie next = cur.getChild(board[row][col]);
        if (next == null) {
            // there is no such prefix. return
            return;
        }
        if (next.getWord() != null) {
            //we found a word
            res.add(next.getWord());
            //to avoid duplicates, remove the string word in the Trie class
            next.resetWord();
        }
        // mark the vistied entry to null char
        char temp = board[row][col];
        board[row][col] = '\0';
        for (int[] dir : DIRS) {
            // try all adjacent cells
            backtrack(board, row + dir[0], col + dir[1], next, res);
        }
        //restore the character
        board[row][col] = temp;
        
    }
    
    //define Trie class
    private static class Trie {
        private final Trie[] children;
        // a modification here. Instead of "boolean isEnd" we save the string here
        // so that we do not need mantain the "path"
        private String word;
        
        public Trie() {
            children = new Trie[26];
        }
        
        public void insert(String s) {
            Trie cur = this;
            for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
                int idx = ch - 'a';
                if (cur.children[idx] == null) {
                    cur.children[idx] = new Trie();
                }
                cur = cur.children[idx];
            }
            cur.word = s;
        }
        
        public Trie getChild(char ch) {
            return this.children[ch - 'a'];
        }
        
        public String getWord() {
            return this.word;
        }
        public void resetWord(){
            this.word = null;
        }
        
    }
```

Time complexity: 

1. inserting to the Trie O(wk) where w is the max length of words in the list and k is the length of the list. 

2. nested loop O(nm) where n is the number of row and m is the number of column. Within each iteration, a backtrack is performed, each time we have 4 directions -> 4^w^. besides the first entry. We actually only has 3 options because we cannot go back. that give us 4 * 3 ^w-1^ O(nm4 * 3^w-1^) ->  O(nm * 3^w-1^) 

   In total, it would be O(nm * 3^w-1^) 

Space complexity: 

1. The Trie class contains O(wk) nodes at most 

2. The max depth of recursion is w -> O(w)

   In total O(wk)

Without the loop in the main function

        }

Time complexity and space complexity does not change.
