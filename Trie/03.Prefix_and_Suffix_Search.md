## Prefix and Suffix Search

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/prefix-and-suffix-search/)

Design a special dictionary with some words that searchs the words in it by a prefix and a suffix.

Implement the WordFilter class:

WordFilter(string[] words) Initializes the object with the words in the dictionary.
f(string prefix, string suffix) Returns the index of the word in the dictionary, which has the prefix prefix and the suffix suffix. If there is more than one valid index, return the largest of them. If there is no such word in the dictionary, return -1.

#### Solution

The BF solution would be costly. For each prefix and suffix search, we need to try different starting words and different starting length and different end words to check if start and end can meet.

We need a way to accelerate the process. For String, trie would be very efficient. But Trie is only for prefix. How to check suffix. One way is to construct two Trie. One is for prefix and the other is for suffix. And try different combinations. But this still time-consuming and we need to track if prefix and suffix offers the same word which could be a O(n) comparision at the end.

To improve this, we can use a special character to represent end of prefix in the Trie. '{' is preferred because it is the next character of 'z' in ASCII table. After this special character, we need to add all the length of its suffix to form Trie. So, here we trade more space for time than the nomal trie for better time complexity.

```java
    private final Trie root;
    public WordFilter(String[] words) {
        root = new Trie();
        for (int i = 0; i < words.length; ++i) {
            Trie.insertWord(root, words[i].toCharArray(), i);
        }
    }
    
    public int f(String prefix, String suffix) {
        Trie cur = root;
        for (int i = 0; i < prefix.length() && cur != null; ++i) {
            cur = cur.getNext(prefix.charAt(i));
        } 
        if (cur == null) {
            return -1;
        }
        cur = cur.getNext('{');
        for (int i = 0; i < suffix.length() && cur != null; ++i) {
            cur = cur.getNext(suffix.charAt(i));
        } 
        return cur == null ? -1 : cur.getIndex();
    }
