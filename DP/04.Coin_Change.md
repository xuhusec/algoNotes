## Coin Change

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change)

Given a collection of coin face value and the amount, figure out the minimum amount of coins of which the sum is equal to the amount. If it is not possible, return -1 instead.

the minimum amount required is the minimum amount of i - coin, for all coins, + 1. 

```
dp[i] = Min(dp[i-coin]) for all coin + 1
```

```java
    public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
        int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
        //populate max value for Math.min
        Arrays.fill(dp, amount + 1);
        dp[0] = 0;
        for (int i = 1 ; i < dp.length; ++i) {
            for (int coin : coins) {
                if (coin <= i) {
                    dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i - coin] + 1, dp[i]);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[amount] > amount ? -1 : dp[amount];
    }
```

Time complexity: iterate over amount and all coins.  O(MN). where M is amount and N is # of coins

Space complexity: O(M);

Is Greedy working?

No. Greedy solutions only work for certain set of coin, e.g. 1,2,5,10. But this is not always true. For example, coins = {1,9,10} and the amount = 18.

The greedy would give 9 (10 + 8 * 1) but the optimal solution is 2 (9 + 9). 

### Coin Change II

Find out how many ways the sum of coins is equal to the amount. Note the coin face value are unique

#### DP

The idea is similar to the above question but this time the dp[i] is how ways the sum of coins is equal to i. But there is one problem. If it is iterate as the previous example, looping amount first and then looping coin, that count different orders as different ways but they should be the same. For example coint: {1,5} and the amount is 6. {1,5} and {5,1} would be count twice however, they should be one.

To fix this, it would change the order of looping, first iterating coins and then iterating amount. In such way, the first shown element in the array would always shown shown in the result first. 

```java
    public int change(int amount, int[] coins) {
        int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
        dp[0] = 1;
        //first iterate coin. Otherwise, there would be duplicated.
        //eg. {1,5} and {5,1} should be one.
        for (int coin : coins) {
            for (int i = 0; i < amount; ++i) {
                if (dp[i] == 0) {
                    continue;
                }
                if (i + coin <= amount) {
                    dp[i + coin] += dp[i];
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[amount];
    }
```

Time complexity O(mn) where , m is the amount,. n is the loop.

Space complexity: O(n)
