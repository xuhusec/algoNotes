## Burst Balloons

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/burst-balloons/)

Given a bunch of  balloons, each of them is given a score. They are saved in an array, say nums. The ith element is the score of the ith balloon. Here is a game. If the ith balloon is burst, the score  nums[i-1] * nums[i] * nums[i+1] is given. If i is the start or the end, i - 1 and/or i + 1 would be out of boundary and nums[i-1] and/or nums[i+1] would be 1 respectively . For a 5-element array, burst the the first balloon in the first round  would give the score 1 * nums[0] * nums[1] and bust the last balloon in the first round would give the score nums[3]\*nums[4]\*1.  After the ith balloon is burst, its neighbors would become adjacent. If we use the above example, if the second balloon is burst in the first round, burst the 3rd balloon in the second round would give score nums[0] * nums[2] * num[3]. Repeat this process and the total score would be the sum of all scores gained during the game. 

Find out the max score, one can get in this game. 

#### BF

1. try to simulate the process. That would lead to the permutation of the array O(n!)
2. Instead of think about which balloon is burst first, try to find which balloon is burst last. This would give (left - 1 < 0 ? 1 : nums[left - 1] ) * nums[last] * (right + 1 >= nums.length ? 1 : nums[right + 1]) + the max score from left to last - 1 +  the max score from last + 1 to right. It is still O(n!)

#### DP

The 2nd BF algorithm can be optimized because there are a lot of redundant work and because this can be written recursively. The max score from left to last - 1 and  the max score from last + 1 to right would be recursive calls. This is a substring type DP problem. To compute the max value of a range, it requires compute the max value of substrings or sub ranges. To improve the performance, we need to keep the max value of sub ranges for future work. As it requires a range, it should be at least 2-D array to tell the start and the end of the range.

```
dp[i][j] = Max(dp[i][k-1] + nums[i-1]*nums[k]*nums[j+1] + dp[k+1][j]) for all K between i and j inclusive.
```

```java
    public int maxCoins(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 1) {
            return nums[0];
        }
        int[][] dp = new int[nums.length][nums.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
            dp[i][i] = getValue(nums,i-1) * getValue(nums,i) * getValue(nums,i+1);
        }
        //for ease of coding, the len is actually length - 1. aka len = 1 is actually for 2 elements
        for (int len = 1; len < nums.length; ++len) {
            for (int left = 0; left < nums.length - len; ++left) {
                int prev = getValue(nums, left - 1);
                int next = getValue(nums, left + len + 1);
                dp[left][left + len] = 0;
                for (int i = left; i <= left + len; ++i) {
                    int temp = prev * getValue(nums,i) * next;
                    if (i > left) { temp += dp[left][i - 1]; }
                    if (i < left + len ) { temp += dp[i + 1][left + len]; }
                    dp[left][left + len] = Math.max(dp[left][left + len], temp);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[0][nums.length - 1];
    }
    // proxy nums to deal with out of boundary case.
    private int getValue(int[] nums, int idx) {
        if (idx < 0 || idx == nums.length) {
            return 1 ;
        }
        return nums[idx];
    }
```

Time complexity:  three nested loops O(n^3)

Space complexity: 2D array O(n^2);
