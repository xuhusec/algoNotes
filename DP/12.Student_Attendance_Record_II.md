## Student Attendance Record II

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/student-attendance-record-ii/)

A student's attendance record in a given day would be one of Present, Late and Absent. A student could get an attendance award if both of the following criteria are met.

1. no more than two Absent records
2. no more than 3 **consecutive** late records.

Find out how many possible kinds of attendance records that a student could get an attendance award. return it modulo 10^9 + 7 to keep it as integer

#### DP

This is similar to the Buy and Sell Stock problem. It requires to get the relationship between status.

Let dp(i,j,k) to be the j absent records and k late records at day i. 

```
// no absent record and no late record can be transformed from the same status the day before and late more no than two consecutive days.
dp(i,0,0) = dp(i-1,0,0) + dp(i-1,0,1) + dp(i-1, 0 , 2)
//absent one day can be converted from no absent records and one absent record. For each case, it contains three late cases
dp(i,1,0) = dp(i-1,1,0) + dp(i-1,0,0) + dp(i-1,1,1) + dp(i-1,1,2) + dp(i-1,0,1) + dp(i-1,0,2)
```



```java
    private final int MOD_BASE = 1_000_000_007;
    public int checkRecord(int n) {
        int[][][] dp = new int[n][2][3];
        //A
        dp[0][1][0] = 1;
        //L
        dp[0][0][1] = 1;
        //P
        dp[0][0][0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            dp[i][0][0] = ((dp[i-1][0][0] + dp[i-1][0][1])%MOD_BASE + dp[i-1][0][2])%MOD_BASE;
            dp[i][0][1] = dp[i-1][0][0];
            dp[i][0][2] = dp[i-1][0][1];
            dp[i][1][0] = (((((dp[i-1][1][0] + dp[i-1][0][0])%MOD_BASE + dp[i-1][0][1])% MOD_BASE + dp[i-1][0][2] )% MOD_BASE + dp[i-1][1][1])% MOD_BASE + dp[i-1][1][2])% MOD_BASE;
            dp[i][1][1] = dp[i-1][1][0];
            dp[i][1][2] = dp[i-1][1][1];
        }
        int res = 0;
        for (int[] array : dp[n-1]) {
            for (int a : array) {
                res = (res + a)%MOD_BASE;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
```

Time complexity:  only iterate over n : O(n)

Space complexity: 2\*3\*n  O(n);

Reduce to constant space.

```java
    private final int MOD_BASE = 1_000_000_007;
    public int checkRecord(int n) {
        int[][] dp = new int[2][3];
        int oneA = 1;
        int oneL = 1;
        int p = 1;
        int twoL = 0;
        int oneAoneL = 0;
        int oneAtwoL = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            int pNew = ((p + oneL)%MOD_BASE + twoL)%MOD_BASE;
            int oneLNew = p;
            int twoLNew = oneL;
            int oneANew = (((((oneA + p)%MOD_BASE + oneL)% MOD_BASE + twoL)% MOD_BASE + oneAoneL)% MOD_BASE + oneAtwoL)% MOD_BASE;
            int oneAoneLNew = oneA;
            int oneAtwoLNew =  oneAoneL;
            
            oneA = oneANew;
            oneL = oneLNew;
            p = pNew;
            twoL = twoLNew;
            oneAoneL = oneAoneLNew;
            oneAtwoL = oneAtwoLNew;
            
        }
        return (((((oneA + oneL)%MOD_BASE + p)%MOD_BASE + twoL)%MOD_BASE + oneAoneL)%MOD_BASE + oneAtwoL)%MOD_BASE;
    }
```

Space complexity: O(1)

Further improvement.

The transform can be seen as a matrix multiplied by a array.

```
dp[i][0][0]   | 0 0 1 0 0 0 |   dp[i-1][0][0]
dp[i][0][1]   | 1 0 1 0 0 0 |   dp[i-1][0][1]
dp[i][0][2] = | 0 1 1 0 0 0 | * dp[i-1][0][2]
dp[i][1][0]   | 0 0 1 0 0 1 |   dp[i-1][1][0]
dp[i][1][1]   | 0 0 1 1 0 1 |   dp[i-1][1][1]
dp[i][1][2]   | 0 0 1 0 1 1 |   dp[i-1][1][2]
```



```
              | 0 0 1 0 0 0 |
              | 1 0 1 0 0 0 |
   Let   A  = | 0 1 1 0 0 0 |
              | 0 0 1 0 0 1 |
              | 0 0 1 1 0 1 |
              | 0 0 1 0 1 1 |
```

The result would be the same to A^n multiplied by the array [1,1,0,1,0,0] (possible records on the first day). A^n can be calculate by  [exponentiating by squaring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring). That calculate exponential power by break it into half if that is even or break it into (p^1) *(p ^ (n-1)) as a recursive call. That gives log(n) time complexity instead of n.
