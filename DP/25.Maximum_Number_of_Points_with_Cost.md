## Maximum Number of Points with Cost

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-points-with-cost/)

You are given an m x n integer matrix points (0-indexed). Starting with 0 points, you want to maximize the number of points you can get from the matrix.

To gain points, you must pick one cell in each row. Picking the cell at coordinates (r, c) will add points[r][c] to your score.

However, you will lose points if you pick a cell too far from the cell that you picked in the previous row. For every two adjacent rows r and r + 1 (where 0 <= r < m - 1), picking cells at coordinates (r, c1) and (r + 1, c2) will subtract abs(c1 - c2) from your score.

Return the maximum number of points you can achieve.

abs(x) is defined as:

x for x >= 0.
-x for x < 0.

### Solution

#### BF
trying all possible routes

#### DP
One would note the current row only depends on maxium points in previous row. We do not care how the previous row get the points but as long as we have such info. The maxium points of the current row can be calculated. 

The only thing left is the penalty. To find the penalty we need to loop the whole previous row for each cell.

```java
    public long maxPoints(int[][] points) {
        final int M = points.length;
        final int N = points[0].length;
        long[][] dp = new long[M][N];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            dp[0][i] = points[0][i];
        }
        long res = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < M; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < N; ++j) {
                int cur = points[i][j];
                for (int k = 0; k < N; ++k) {
                    if (k < j) {
                        dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][k] + cur + k - j);
                    } else {
                        dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][k] + cur + j - k);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        for (int j = 0; j < N; ++j) { 
            res = Math.max(res, dp[M - 1][j]);
        }
        return res;
    }
```

Can we do better? The anwser is yes. Let check the dp[i-1][k] + points[i][j] - |k - j|. Or
```
dp[i-1][k] + points[i][j] + k - j //for k <= j
// or
dp[i-1][k] + points[i][j] + j - k // for k >= j
```  
Let us focus on the case k < j.

dp[i-1][k] + points[i][j] + k - j This happens in nested loop under j. That means for all k. j is the same. Simliarly i is same as well.
Let us group the equation to unchanged part and changed part in terms of k

(points[i][j] - j) + (dp[i-1][k] + k)

We are maximize the above equation Math.max((points[i][j] - j) + (dp[i-1][k] + k)) = points[i][j] - j + Math.max(dp[i-1][k] + k) for k <= j.
We only need maximize dp[i-1][k] + k for all k <= j. This can preprocessed. The max value for j = 0 is dp[i-1][0] + 0. The max value for j = 1 is the max of previous max value and dp[i-1][1] + 1. so on and so forth. We can have a separe array or a single value to keep track of this max.

Simliarly for k >= j (points[i][j] + j) + (dp[i-1][k] - k). That is the max value from the right. The result can be pre processed and stored in an array.

```java
    public long maxPoints(int[][] points) {
        final int m = points.length;
        final int n = points[0].length;
        long[] dp = new long[n];
        long[] left = new long[n];
        long[] right = new long[n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            dp[i] = points[0][i];
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i < m; ++i) {
            left[0] = dp[0] + 0;
            for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j) {
                left[j] = Math.max(left[j-1], dp[j] + j); 
            }
            right[n-1] = dp[n-1] - n + 1;
            for (int j = n - 2; j >= 0; --j) {
                right[j] = Math.max(right[j+1], dp[j] - j);
            }
            
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                dp[j] = Math.max(left[j] - j, right[j] + j) + points[i][j];
            }
        }
        long res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            res = Math.max(res, dp[i]);
        }
        return res;
    }
