## Jump Game

Given an integer array,  each element tells the maximum length that can be jumped from that point. You are start at the first index of the array. Please check if you are able to reach the last index.

#### BF

Try all possible jump length at each index.

```java
public boolean canJump(int[] nums) {
    return canJump(nums,0);
}

private boolean canJump(int[] nums, int idx) {
    if (idx == nums.length - 1) {
        return true;
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= nums[idx] && i + idx < nums.length; ++i) {
        if (canJump(nums,i + idx)) {
            return true;
        }
    }        
    return false;
}
```

#### DP

The above BF solution can be translated to a suffix DP solution. 

```java
    public boolean canJump(int[] nums) {
        boolean[] dp = new boolean[nums.length];
        dp[nums.length - 1] = true;
        for (int i = nums.length - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= nums[i]; ++j) {
                if (j + i >= nums.length) {
                    break;
                }
                if (dp[j + i]) {
                    dp[i] = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[0];
    }
```

Time complexity: traverse all elements and check all the elements after it each time .  O(n<sup>2</sup>).

Space complexity: O(n);

#### Two Pointer

Note the above DP solution can be further optimized during check if an intermediate index can jump to the last index. If an index can be reached should be able to check with additional if i + max jump at i >= target index. Then the target can be reached. If an index, say i, can reach the last index, other index is also able to reach the last as long as they are able to reach i as from i one is able to jump to the last index.  Instead of a dp array. One actually needs the smallest index can jump to the last index. And finally check if that is 0. 

```java
    public boolean canJump(int[] nums) {
        int last = nums.length - 1;
        for (int i = nums.length - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (i + nums[i] >= last) {
                last = i;
            }
        }
        return last == 0;
    }
```

Time complexity: traverse all elements.  O(n).

Space complexity: O(1);

#### Jump Game II

The same as the above question. But this time, try to figure out the minimal number of steps to reach the last index. Note the input would guarantee that last index is reachable.

##### DP

Modify the last DP solution to record the least number of jumps from the current index to the last index.

```java
    public int jump(int[] nums) {
        int[] dp = new int[nums.length];
        Arrays.fill(dp,Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        dp[nums.length - 1] = 0;
        for (int i = nums.length - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= nums[i]; ++j) {
                if (j + i >= nums.length) {
                    break;
                }
                if (dp[j + i] < Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
                    dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], 1 + dp[j + i]) ;
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[0];
    }
```

Time complexity and Space complexity:  are the same as the DP solution above

##### Two Pointer

The least jump steps is kind of greedy strategy. The first step that is able to jump to the last step would be the intermediate steps in the optimal solution. Then we can search from the start again to find the index the least jump would pass through. Repeat this process until reach the start.

```java
    public int jump(int[] nums) {
        int res = 0;
        int last = nums.length - 1;
        while (last > 0 ) {
            for (int i = 0; i < last; ++i) {
                if (i + nums[i] >= last) {
                    last = i;
                    res++;
                    break;
                }
                
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
```

Time complexity: Every time move backward for 1 in the while loop O(n<sup>2</sup>)

Space complexity: O(1)

How about one may not reach the last index. DP would still work. But it returns Integer.MAX_VALUE for such case. The two pointer or greed solution would be in infinite loop. But this can be fixed by adding a variable to check if any improvement was mad during last iteration. The following code would return -1  for i

```java
    public int jump(int[] nums) {
        int res = 0;
        int last = nums.length - 1;
        boolean isChanged;
        while (last > 0 ) {
            isChanged = false;
            for (int i = 0; i < last; ++i) {
                if (i + nums[i] >= last) {
                    last = i;
                    res++;
                    isChanged = true;
                    break;
                }
                
            }
            if (!isChanged) {
               return -1;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
```
