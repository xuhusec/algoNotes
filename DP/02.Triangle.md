## Triangle

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/triangle/)

Given a 2 dimension triangle array which the col is equals to the row number + 1 , row number starting from 0, in each row. the cost of going through each element is its value. Find out the path with minimum cost.

```
   2
  3 4
 6 5 7
4 1 8 3
```

#### BF

a naive way to try all possible paths and get the minimum, this can star from top or from bottom. However we can do better. For a given node, the path from the bottom to that node is either go through two nodes in next row. To get the minimum path to that node, it needs to select the minimum path to those two nodes (say node 1 and node 2) + its cost. The minimum path to those two nodes is only determined by the minimum path to node 1 and that to node 2. This can be translate to a recursive function.

```java
    public int minimumTotal(List<List<Integer>> triangle) {
        return minimumTotal(triangle,0,0);
    }
    private int minimumTotal(List<List<Integer>> triangle, int row, int col) {
        if (triangle.size() - 1 == row) {
            return triangle.get(row).get(col);
        }
        return triangle.get(row).get(col) + Math.min(minimumTotal(triangle,row + 1,col),minimumTotal(triangle,row + 1, col + 1));
    }
```

#### DP

Appreantly, there are many duplicates during the computation. E.g  minimumTotal(triangle,3,2) = triangle.get(3).get(2) + Math.min(minimumTotal(triangle,4,2),minimumTotal(triangle,4, 3)), minimumTotal(triangle,4,2) = triangle.get(4).get(2) + Math.min(minimumTotal(triangle,5,2),minimumTotal(triangle,5, 3)) and minimumTotal(triangle,4,3) = triangle.get(4).get(2) + Math.min(minimumTotal(triangle,5,3),minimumTotal(triangle,5, 4)). minimumTotal(triangle,5,3) is called multiple times. To reduce the duplication call, we can apply dp. The optimal substructure is

```
dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i+1][j],dp[i+1][j+1]) + cell[i][j];
```

Because only dp[i+1][j] and dp[i+1][j+1] in previous calculation matters when dp[i][j] is computed. The dp matrix can be reduced to one dimension array. If dp[j] replaces the dp[j] computed in previous row, dp[j+1] is not affected because it depends on dp[j+1] and dp[j+2] in previous row and both of them are untouched when dp[j] is updated. 

Further, to reduce the initialization of the last row, the dp array can be initialized with triangle heights + 1 as if there is an additional row and all of them are zeros. That make all first n values after first iteration became cell[lastRow].

```java
    public int minimumTotal(List<List<Integer>> triangle) {
        int[] dp = new int[triangle.size()+1];
        for (int i = triangle.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            List<Integer> list = triangle.get(i);
            for (int j = 0; j < list.size(); ++j) {
                dp[j] = Math.min(dp[j],dp[j+1]) + list.get(j);
            }
        }
        return dp[0];
    }
```

Time complexity: traverse all elements. (1 + 2 + .. + n ) = (n+1) * n /2.  O(n<sup>2</sup>).

Space complexity: O(n);

How about iterate from top?

If build dp from top. For each row, it would require check if the current entry is the first entry or if that is the last entry. Both cases, first and last entry, require special treatment because there is only one way from last row to travel to them. And to figure out the minimum path, all the minimum path to the nodes in the last row would become candidates. That make the implementation troublesome.

```java
    public int minimumTotal(List<List<Integer>> triangle) {
        int res = triangle.get(0).get(0);
        if (triangle.size() == 1) { return res; }
        int[] previous = {res};
        res = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 1 ; i < triangle.size(); ++i) {
            List<Integer> curList = triangle.get(i);
            int[] cur = new int[curList.size()];
            boolean isLastRow = i == triangle.size() - 1;
            for (int j = 0; j <= i ; ++j) {
                int cand = 0;
                if ( j == 0) {
                    cand = previous[j] + curList.get(j);
                } else if ( j == i) {
                    cand = previous[j - 1] +curList.get(j);
                } else {
                    cand = Math.min(previous[j],previous[j - 1]) + curList.get(j);
                }
                cur[j] = cand;
                if (isLastRow) { res = Math.min(res,cand); }
            }
            previous = cur;
        }
        return  res;
    }
```

Time complexity: O(n<sup>2</sup>).

Space complexity: maximum previous array is n -1 and the max is n. so O(2n-1) = O(n)
