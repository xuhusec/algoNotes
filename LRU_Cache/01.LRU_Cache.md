## LRU Cache

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/)

Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a **[Least Recently Used (LRU) cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#LRU)**.

Implement the `LRUCache` class:

- `LRUCache(int capacity)` Initialize the LRU cache with **positive** size `capacity`.
- `int get(int key)` Return the value of the `key` if the key exists, otherwise return `-1`.
- `void put(int key, int value)` Update the value of the `key` if the `key` exists. Otherwise, add the `key-value` pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the `capacity` from this operation, **evict** the least recently used key.

The functions `get` and `put` must each run in `O(1)` average time complexity.

### Solution

How LRU works is already introduced in the Introduction section. This problem is asking for `get` and `put` in O(1) average time. The age-bits might not be easy for this task. So, we would try the second approach. LinkedList + HashMap. Although standard Java implementation provide both implementation. But we can not get the Node object in LinkedList. Without getting that, It is hard to achieve O(1) time to move the Node the head of the list. So we need to implement our own ListNode object for this reason. Because we need to find the parent of the node and the child of this node quickly, we need a doubly linked List. A singly linked list would only find the child/next node in O(1) but the parent/pre node would cost O(n). 

Also, we can use some tricks in the ListNode object.  It would be error-prone to check the head of the list and the end of the list. To avoid treat them specially. We can have two sentinel nodes in the front and end. Because they would not be removed any time. We have a universal strategy for all nodes.

The HashMap and LinkedList are both linear data structure. This problem check them together.

```java
class LRUCache {
    private final ListNode first;
    private ListNode last;
    private final Map<Integer, ListNode> map;
    private final int capacity;

    public LRUCache(int capacity) {
        first = new ListNode(0,0);
        last = new ListNode(0,0);
        // link two sentinel nodes
        first.next = last;
        last.pre = first;
        map = new HashMap<>();
        this.capacity = capacity;
        
    }
    
    public int get(int key) {
        // get the cache and check if it is exists
        ListNode node = map.get(key);
        if (node == null) {
            return -1;
        }
        // move just used cache to the front
        moveToFront(node);
        return node.val;
        
    }
    
    public void put(int key, int value) {
        // check if the key already exists.
        ListNode cur = map.get(key);
        if (cur == null) {
            // add a new key if we cannot find a record
            cur = new ListNode(key, value);
            // check if we have enough space
            if (map.size() == capacity) {
                //remove the last cache node (previous node of the last sentinel node)
                map.remove(last.pre.key);
                last.pre = last.pre.pre;
                last.pre.next = last;
            }
            map.put(key,cur);
        } else {
            cur.val = value;
        }
        // move the node to the front of the list
        moveToFront(cur);
    }
    
    private void moveToFront(ListNode node) {
        // check if this is a new node
        if (node.pre != null) {
            // if it is the first cache node, we do nothing
            if (node.pre == first) {
               return;
            }
            // connect its previous node and next node
            // remove it from the orginal position
            node.pre.next = node.next;
            node.next.pre = node.pre;
        }
        // insert to the front
        // get the original front node as next
        node.next = first.next;
        // set the original front node's previous node as the current node
        node.next.pre = node;
        // make the fist sentinel node pointing to the current node as next
        first.next = node;
        // make the first sentinel node as previous node
        node.pre = first;
    }
    
    private static class ListNode {
        private ListNode pre;
        private ListNode next;
        private int val;
        private final int key;
        
        public ListNode(int key, int val) {
            this.val = val;
            this.key = key;
        }
    }
}

/**
 * Your LRUCache object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * LRUCache obj = new LRUCache(capacity);
 * int param_1 = obj.get(key);
 * obj.put(key,value);
 */
```

Time complexity: O(1)

Space complexity; O(capacity)
