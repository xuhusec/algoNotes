## Array

Array supports random access -> the lookup is O(1). Common operations like iterate over the array. find ith element. Those can be resolved by one pointer (or index). Sometimes, you may need another index. That index can help to specify a range. A common technique is to shrink the range to filter out the solution -> two pointers or binary search (especially in sorted array). Or keep moving both ends -> sliding window. 

Two pointers or binary search are usually work for given sorted array. A unsorted array could be sort first and then apply those two techniques. When the final answer also appears with sorting order but the array is given unsorted, a procedure like merge sort/ divide and conquer may help. Those would be talked in another section.

### Two Sum

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

Return the indices of an integer array so that the sum of the elements specified by the indices is equal to the target. 

#### BF

Try all the indices with nested loop to enumerate every possible solutions and valid them.

```java
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; ++i) {
            for (int j = i+1; j < nums.length; ++j) {
                if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                    return new int[]{i,j};
                }
            }
        }
        return new int[0];
    }
```

Time complexity: nested loop -> O(n^2);

Space complexity: O(1)

#### HashMap

The Brute Force method checks every i with other combinations. We actually needs to check if target - nums[i] is in the array. This should have a map (not set because we need the index instead of value). One way is to add all the elements in the map first and check the target - nums[i]. (Note, this method requires record the last location if there are duplicates and one would need to check if the candidate is the current  element. e.g. the target is 6 and there is only one 3 in the element. the index of 3 would be returned but we only have one 3. We need to tell if the map return the nums[i] itself). But we can improve this by iterate once. We can add the element to the map along check target - nums[i]. The two elements must have one come first and the other can later. The later one would be able to check if the previous one in the map.

```java
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        if (nums==null || nums.length < 2) {return new int[0];}
        Map<Integer,Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length ; i++) {
            if (map.containsKey(target - nums[i])) {
                return new int[]{map.get(target - nums[i]).intValue(), i};
            }
            map.put(nums[i],i);
        }
        return new int[0];
    }
```

Time complexity: O(n)

Space complexity: Map -> O(n) Time-space trade off

#### Variation

##### Two sum with sorted array

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)

By add the array sorted. This enables two pointer method. We can start from the two ends. If the sum of them is larger than the target, we move the right end to decrease the sum. If the sum of them is smaller than the target, we move the left end to increase the sum. Repeat the process until the solution is found or two ends met. The original question is not suitable for this approach because it asks return the index. Sorting would remove the index. Of course one can write a custom sort to sort the auxiliary array of the indices of the original array but that would be overkilled.

```java
    public int[] twoSum(int[] numbers, int target) {
        int lo = 0;
        int hi = numbers.length - 1;
        while (lo < hi) {
            int sum = numbers[lo] + numbers[hi];
            if (sum > target) {
                hi--;
            } else if (sum < target) {
                lo++;
            } else {
                return new int[]{lo+1,hi+1};
            }
        }
        return new int[0];
    }
```

##### Sum of Square Numbers

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-square-numbers/)

Given a non-negative integer c, decide whether there're two integers a and b such that a^2^+ b^2^ = c. Note, a and b could be 0.

Analysis

This question is a variant of "Two sum with sorted array". Although the question does not provide any sorted array. We have a and b. If we assume a <= b, they can be viewed as picking form a square number array which is by default in natural order which means that is sorted. It is just "Two sum with square number array". That leads to the following solution with some modification of the "Two sum with sorted array".

```java
public boolean judgeSquareSum(int c) {
    int i = 0;
    //start from sqrt(c) instead of c
    // 1. reduce the time complexity
    // 2. c <= 2^31 - 1. c * c would be overflow
    int j = (int) Math.sqrt(c);
    while (i <= j) {
        var temp = i * i + j * j;
        if (temp > c) {
            j--;
        } else if (temp < c) {
            i++;
        } else {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

Time complexity: O(sqrt(n)) (Finding sqrt(n) would be log(n), assuming binary search but that could be improved by Newtonâ€“Raphson method.  sqrt(n) is greater than log(n))

### Container With Most Water

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

An array of non-negative integers represents the height of a vertical bar can be inserted at each location. A container would be formed with two bars and x-axis. Find out the container contains the most water. 

E.g. [1,0,5]. The container is with bar (0,1)  and (2,5). And it contains 1 * (2-0) = 2 units of water. 

#### Brute Force

The simplest logic is to iterate over a nest loop to enumerate every possible combinations of two side and take the minimum of the two and check if the area is the max.

#### Two Pointer

Note the the max area is computed by w * h. where w is the width on x-axis and h is the minimum height of the two bars.  The max width the the length of the whole array - 1. And that value multiplied by the minimum of the ends would get the maximum area with max width.

But there might be higher bars in the middle so we need to continue check. How should the we select which sides to move? Apparently, the smaller of the two should be removed. That because after moving the width is the same (minus 1) but the higher bar is potentially to contain more water. It is not worse than the shorter one. For the shorter one, the previous calculated value is the max area it can form because it was the shorter one and the height of the container would not exceed its height but the width is shrinking. The taller bar on the other hand might find a higher bar for a deeper container. For a special case that the two bars are in the same height. It would be fine to move either of them. That is because the height takes shorter one. After one moving, it would be 3 cases: > h, =h and <h. But there is one bar left. The height of the container is still h however the width is shrinking. None of them would be the solution. Moving any side would just help to find the next candidate.

```java
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int res = 0;
        int width = height.length - 1;
        int lo = 0;
        int hi = height.length - 1;
        while (lo < hi) {
            int h = Math.min(height[lo],height[hi]);
            res = Math.max(res, h * width);
            if (height[lo] < height[hi]) {
                lo++;
            } else { // for height[lo] == height[hi], it can move either side.
                hi--;
            }
            width--;
        }
        return res;
    }
```

### Move Zeroes

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)

Move all 0's in an array to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of others. (should not make a copy of the array)

#### Extra Array

initiate an array. copy non zero element to the array and copy back to the original.

```java
    public void moveZeroes(int[] nums) {
        int[] copy = new int[nums.length]
        int j = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
            if (nums[i] != 0) {
                copy[j++] = nums[i];
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; ++j) {
            nums[i] = copy[i];
        }
    }
```

Time complexity: two loop but not nested O(n)

Space complexity: O(n)

This is not the answer because the array should not be copied. But this would help us to think other solutions.

#### Move elements with two pointer

As one noted in the extra array solution. It is actually no need to copy the element in the copy array. It can be the nums array itself. j would be the slow pointer to move if and only if nums[i] is not zero. Because i is traveling fast than or equal to j. change value in j would not future work of i. But when i reach the end, we should fill the rest to 0's because they have been moved to the front.

```java
    public void moveZeroes(int[] nums) {
        int j = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
            if (nums[i] != 0) {
                nums[j++] = nums[i];
            }
        }
        while (j < nums.length) {
            nums[j++] = 0;
        }
    }
```

Time complexity:  O(n)

Space complexity: O(1)

#### Two Pointer Swap

The last approach can be improved. It is clear that when i != j first time , j would point to a zero and it should be swap with the first non zero nums[i] after j. After swap nums[i] and nums[j], nums[i] would be zero and nums[j] would be not. nums[j+1] would be zero again and the next non-zero element should be swap with this value again because this non-zero element is the first non-zero element. All the previous analysis would apply here as well. Repeat this problem would lead to the solution

```java
    public void moveZeroes(int[] nums) {
        int j = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
            if (nums[i] != 0 ) {
                if (i != j) {
                    int temp = nums[i];
                    nums[i] = nums[j];
                    nums[j] = temp;
                }
                j++;
            }
        }
    }
```

Time complexity:  O(n)

Space complexity: O(1)

Note the swap two element snippet can be replaced by the following as we know nums[j] must be zero in this case.

```java
nums[j] = nums[i];
nums[i] = 0;
```

If one familiar with the quicksort. The swap technique would remind the process of finding the position of the pivot. The pivot is the last element of the focused range of an array (that could be a random element swapped to the end), then you have two pointers. One is always moves. The other is moved only when an element less than the pivot is found. The latter pointer would swap the element with current element and move to the next. Finally the later pointer would swap its current element with the last element i.e the pivot.

### 3 Sum

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)

Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j],nums[k]] such that i < j < k and nums[i\] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0

### Binary Search

The simplest logics is to try all combinations that would lead to an O(n^3) algorithm. However, if two of the numbers are fixed, the other one can be looked up with O(log(n)) if the array is sorted. So we can first sort the array and try to find the solutions. To avoid duplicates, the duplicates should be skipped.

```java
   public List<List<Integer>> threeSum(int[] nums) {
        List<List<Integer>> res = new ArrayList<>();
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; ++i) {
            //skip duplicates
            if (i > 0 && nums[i] == nums[i-1]) {
                continue;
            }
            for (int j = i+1; j < nums.length - 1; ++j) {
                if (j > i+1 && nums[j] == nums[j-1]) {
                    continue;
                }
                int idx = Arrays.binarySearch(nums, j+1, nums.length, 0 - nums[i] - nums[j]);
                //if the target is found
                if (idx > 0) {
                    res.add(List.of(nums[i],nums[j],nums[idx]));
                }
            }
        
       }
       return res;
   }

```

 Time complexity: O(n^2log(n))

Space complexity: O(1) (Arrays.sort is Dual-Pivot Quicksort)

#### Two Pointer

Like talked in "Two sum with sorted array". "Two sum with sorted array" can be resolved with two pointers in O(n) time. This is also applied to 3 sum when one of the number is fixed. This actually can be applied to n sum. Fix the first n-2 numbers and the last two number can be found with two pointers.

```java
    public List<List<Integer>> threeSum(int[] nums) {
        List<List<Integer>> res = new ArrayList<>();
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; ++i) {
            if (i > 0 && nums[i] == nums[i-1]) {
                continue;
            }
            int x = nums[i];
            int lo = i + 1;
            int hi = nums.length - 1;
            while (lo < hi) {
                int sum = nums[lo] + nums[hi];
                if (x + sum > 0) {
                    hi--;
                } else if (x + sum < 0) {
                    lo++;
                } else {
                   res.add(List.of(x, nums[lo], nums[hi]));
                   while (lo < hi && nums[lo + 1] == nums[lo]) {
                       lo++;
                   }
                    while (lo < hi && nums[hi - 1] == nums[hi]) {
                        hi--;
                    }
                    lo++;
                    hi--;
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
```

##### 3 sum closest

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/)

Instead of 0, there is a target as the sum of three numbers and the target may not be feasible by adding three numbers in the array. Find out the closet sum of any 3 numbers in the array that is closest to the target.

**Binary search**

the logic is similar to the 3 sum question. when the target is not in the array. Try the left element of the insertion point and the insertion point itself. To determine the result. Be careful with the boundary (i.e. nums.length)

**Two Pointer**

The logic is similar here. When one of the number is fixed. The other two can be found by two pointers. It is just find the sum with minimal difference during the search process. And of course, when the sum is target, there is no need for another try.

```java
    public int threeSumClosest(int[] nums, int target) {
        //the max of nums is 1000. set a value that way larger than it. Integer.MAX_VALUE might cause overflow
        int res = 10000;

##### Valid Triangle Number

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-triangle-number/)

Given a non-negative integer array, find total number of combinations that three of them can form a triangle. The elements in different positions are counted as different solutions. For example if we have [3,3,....] starting from first 3 (using the first 3 as the first element) and starting from the second 3 are counted as different solutions.

**Analysis**

For three numbers to form a triangle. The sum of two sides is greater than the other side. It is hard to track all the combinations. The first idea to simplify this is to sort the array. After that, only the last element picked in the array by order can exceed the sum of the other two. The sub problem becomes when the two short slides fixed, how many  elements is capable of being the third side or is less than the sum of the two short sides.  You see this is very similar to the 3 sum smaller. The difference is the target is changed for every two short sides.

**Binary Search**

As we have array sorted, find out all valid combinations for two fixed sides is to find the  index of the largest valid third side options. The difference between this index and the index of the second short side is how many options available.  

```java
    public int triangleNumber(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length < 3) {
            return 0;
        }
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; ++i) {
            // zero can not be valid options
            if (nums[i] == 0) {
                continue;
            }
            int s1 = nums[i];
            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length - 1; ++j) {
                int s2 = s1 + nums[j];
                // start from 0 count case;
                int lo = j;
                int hi = nums.length - 1;
                int k = lo;
                while (lo <= hi) {
                    int mid = lo + (hi - lo)/2;
                    if (nums[mid] >= s2) {
                        hi = mid - 1;
                    } else {
                        k = mid;
                        lo = mid + 1;
                    }
                }
                res += k - j;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
```

**Two pointer**

Similarly to other 3 sum questions, binary search method may not start best position. After first search, we know for the next j, the target would be at least at the result of the first search. That is because the sum increased as j increased. The array is sorted so the target is at least at the result of the last because of the sum increased. In this case, we can keep the position of the last result with two pointer. unlike other 3 sum solutions, they move against each other, the two pointer here would move in the same directions.

```java
    public int triangleNumber(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length < 3) {
            return 0;
        }
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; ++i) {
            if (nums[i] == 0) {
                continue;
            }
            int s1 = nums[i];
            int k = i + 1;
            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length - 1; ++j) {
                int s2 = s1 + nums[j];
                k = Math.max(k,j);
                while (k < nums.length - 1 && s2 > nums[k + 1]) {
                    k++;
                }
                res += k - j;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
```

Time complexity: Loop of *k* and *j* will be executed O(n^2^) times in total, because, we do not reinitialize the value of *k* for a new value of *j* chosen(for the same *i*). Thus the complexity will be *O*(*n*^2^+*n*^2^)=*O*(*n*^2^).

Space complexity:  Arrays.sort is Dual-Ended Quicksort -> O(1)

One might think it may improve the performance by modifying the binary search solution with lo = k every time. It did improve the performance of binary search but the result shows it way worse than the above solutions. It may because array caching and for the worse case loop of k and j would exceed  O(n^2^). For example there is no the other side for i and j every time and that costs O(nlogn) for every i -> O(n^2^ log(n)).

**other thoughts**

A more interesting question would be finding out the the non-duplicated solution. This is easy for the first two sides. The loop should skip if the element is equal to previous element. The nest loop would check if it > i + 1 first. Otherwise, solutions such as [3,3,3] would be missed. How about the third side? We can have a dedicated variable to record unique nums[k]  for each i.  when j moves, we can check if new j removed a unique k identified in previous iteration. If nums[j] == nums[j+1], we do not need to touch the count. Otherwise, it is decreased by 1. This is kind of sliding windows for the third side.

```java
    public int triangleNumberWithoutDup(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length < 3) {
            return 0;
        }
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; ++i) {
            //skip zeros and duplicated shortest side
            if (nums[i] == 0 || (i > 0 && nums[i] == nums[i-1]) ) {
                continue;
            }
            int s1 = nums[i];
            int k = i + 1;
            int cnt = 0;
            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length - 1; ++j) {
                if (j > i + 1) {
                    // if j moved to a unique ke nums[j] == nums[j + 1] means a dup
                    // nums[j] < nums[j + 1] meaning a unique k is removed.
                    // only when cnt > 0 should we take care of the unique k.
                    // Otherwise it means no valid k found last round
                    if (cnt > 0 && nums[j] < nums[j + 1]) {
                        cnt--;
                    }
                    //skip dup second side.
                    if (nums[j] == nums[j-1]) { continue; }
                }
                
                int s2 = s1 + nums[j];
                k = Math.max(k, j);
                while (k < nums.length - 1 && s2 > nums[k + 1]) {
                    // k would move to k + 1. If nums[k+1] and nums[k] are different,
                    // we find a unique element in nums[k + 1], the cnt should increase
                    if (k == i + 1 || nums[k + 1] > nums[k]) {
                        cnt++;
                    }
                    k++;
                }
                res += cnt;
            }

### Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)

An array is sorted in non-decreasing order, remove duplicates in-places and keep the relative order of the elements. The return value should be an integer, k, tells the first k elements should be the length of new array.



If the array is not sorted and extra space is allowed, one may use LinkedHashSet (or a set and a list) to filter out the duplicates and assign the unique elements back to the array in order (Time O(n), Space O(n)). However, the array is sorted, that means the duplicates must be adjacent. That is a easy checkout if an element is a duplicate of  another. One can still create a new array to record unique elements. (Time O(n) Space O(n)). To reduce the space complexity, the same technique used in "move zeros" would help. We can have two pointers. A fast pointer would travel regardless of duplication but the slow pointer would travel if an element is not duplicates of its previous element. The slow pointer would also assign that value to its old position.

```java
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        int i = 1;
        int j = 1;
        while (j < nums.length) {
            if (nums[j] > nums[j-1]) {
                nums[i++] = nums[j];
            }
            j++;
        }
        return i;
    }
```

Time complexity : O (n)

Space complexity: O(1)

It is easy to spot when i == j there is no need to assign values. So we can modify as follow.

```java
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        //start from 0 so that we can move it every time
        int i = 0;
        int j = 1;
        while (j < nums.length) {
            if (nums[j] > nums[j-1] && ++i < j) {
                nums[i] = nums[j];
            }
            j++;
        }
        //need to move one more as array starts from 0
        return ++i;
    }
```

### Rotate Array

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/)

Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps (k >= 0). In each step, one would take one element from the end, the rest of array would be shift to the right by one and put the took element to the beginning of the array.  

#### Brute force

Brute force would simulate the process take one from the end each time. But one should notice that when k > the length of the array, all the elements are moved to pass it original positions at least once. There is no need to simulate cycles. We only need to take care of k%(the length of the array). Each step would result O(n) Time complexity O(n^2). Space complexity O(1)

#### Extra Space

insertion and move the rest of the element is costly in an array. Note the result of the rotate array is to move last k elements to the beginning of the array and move the rest accordingly. To avoid moving the other elements every time, an extra array would help.

```java
 public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
     k = k % nums.length;
     int[] arr = new int[nums.length];
     int idx = 0;
     for (int i = nums.length - k; i < nums.length; ++i) {
         arr[idx++] = nums[i];
     }
     for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - k; ++i) {
         arr[idx++] = nums[i];
     }
     for (int i = 0; i < nums.lengthl ++i) {
         nums[i] = arr[i];
     }
 }
```

Time complexity: O(n)

Space complexity: O(n);

#### Reverse

The follow up question is to solve this with O(1) extra space. Of course, it is not the brute force solution. Check the result of the rotation. It is to move the last k elements to the beginning of the array. This can be done by three reverses. The first reverse is to reverse the whole array. The second reverse would reverse the first k elements and the third reverse would reverse the rest. The first reverse make sure the end would appears earlier than the beginning. The second reverse make the first k elements in original relative order. The third reverse is similar. 

```java
    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        if (nums.length < 2) return;
        k = k% nums.length;
        if (k < 1) return;
        reverse(nums,0, nums.length-1);
        reverse(nums,0,k-1);
        reverse(nums,k,nums.length-1);
        
    }
    
    private void reverse(int[] nums, int start, int end) {
        while (start < end) {
            var temp = nums[start];
            nums[start++] = nums[end];
            nums[end--] = temp;
        }
    }
```

Space complexity: O(1)

### Merge Sorted Array

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/)

This question is similar to Merge Sorted List. Two array are given,  the second array is sorted and the first m elements of the first array is sorted. The rest of the array fills with 0's.  Merge the two sorted array (first m elements in array 1 and the second array) into one array in-place.



Merge two sorted array is one of the major steps in merge sort. However, in merge sort, it may not be easier to merge them in place because they are adjacent parts in a array. For this problem, it is very hard if you starts from beginning of the two array if no extra space is used because when we place some elements from array 2. How do you deal with the original element in array 1. Note the to-be replaced element in array 1 does not have to be the smallest element in the rest of array2. Of course, one can allocate a new array and fill the element accordingly. This would result to O(m+n) extra space. Can we resolve this in-place? One of the approach is to look backward. Instead of pick the smaller between two head of both arrays. We can pick up the larger between two tails of the arrays. Why this works. This is because the picked element would fill the extra/checked space in array1. Change that position does not affect future comparison but look from the beginning does.

```java
    public void merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n) {
        int i = m - 1;
        int j = n - 1;
        int idx = nums1.length - 1;
        while (idx >= 0) {
            if (j < 0 || i >= 0 && nums1[i] > nums2[j]) {
                nums1[idx--] = nums1[i--];
            } else {
                nums1[idx--] = nums2[j--];
            }
        }
    }
```

### Plus One

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one/)

A non-negative integer is represented by a decimal digits array. The last element indicts 1's and the second last indicts 10's so on and so force. There is no leading zeros. If there is no other digits [0] is only the case where the array consists only 0. Please plus one to the integer.



This question is like the previous one. It is better to look backward. The only concern here is that one may need to add one additional digits in the front in that case all digits are 9's.

```java
    public int[] plusOne(int[] digits) {
        boolean shouldAddOne = true;
        for (int i = digits.length - 1; i >=0; i--) {
            var temp = digits[i] + (shouldAddOne ? 1 : 0);
            shouldAddOne = temp > 9;
            digits[i] = temp % 10;
        }
        
        if (shouldAddOne) {
            int[] temp = new int[digits.length + 1];
            temp[0] = 1;
            System.arraycopy(digits,0,temp,1,digits.length);
            digits = temp;
        }
        return digits;
        
    }
```

Time complexity: O(n)

Space complexity:  if requires adding one to the front an array of n+1 is created. O(n)

Usually, in-place change of the input without proper document might cause trouble in real word project. So the following solution would operate on a new created array all the time.

```java
    public int[] plusOne(int[] digits) {
        int[] res = new int[digits.length + 1];
        boolean addOne = true;
        for (int i = digits.length - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (addOne) {
                if (digits[i] == 9) {
                    res[i + 1] = 0;
                } else {
                    res[i + 1] = digits[i] + 1 ;
                    addOne = false;
                }
            } else {
                res[i + 1] = digits[i];
            }
        }
        if (addOne) {
            res[0] = 1;
        } else {
            return Arrays.copyOfRange(res, 1, res.length);
        }
        return res;
    }
```
